@0    = ~Tazok!~
@1    = ~Well, well... we meet again. Did you think that I'd die as easily as your girl?~
@2    = ~I will cast you into the Hells if I have to follow you!~
@3    = ~Tazok! You have nowhere to run now. My vow will be fulfilled at last. Deheriana, melamin, this hour of blood is ours!~
@4    = ~Heh. My small folk will have an elf-head to play with tonight!~
@5    = ~I will cast you into the Abyss where you belong!~
@6    = ~Th-thank you, adventurers. I... I have found this gem when mining... was saving it for my lady, but... you gave me my life back, and I have nothing else to pay you for your bravery...~
@7    = ~Then it is for your lady, my friend. Now go, before more of the 'demons' come.~
@8    = ~But your life is a gift enough for her. Thank you for the gem.~
@9    = ~Are you still here, coward? Get out of my sight, before I kill you myself. Heh, scared of kobolds!~
@10   = ~Try to stay to the shadows and ask the guards to escort you to the surface.~
@11   = ~I will, Master Elf. I'll tell the guards and Master Emerson himself how brave you are. Hope you'll kill all the monsters down below quickly - a man has to earn his living.~
@12   = ~No doubt he would, if things are as bad as they made it sound. We would do well, <CHARNAME>, to find the lad as soon as we are able. These guards do not look like the sort that would arm the workers, even against grave danger. I doubt that a common man can defeat the evil creatures that I smell, but a dagger is better than bare hands.~
@13   = ~My condolences, good woman. I... I know how much it hurts to lose your beloved. I wish I could offer you more than words.~
@14   = ~*sob*~
@15   = ~<CHARNAME>, I refuse to believe that any man in his right mind would slay his own kin.~
@16   = ~It is pleasant to know that our labours are well appreciated, <CHARNAME>.~
@17   = ~I will gladly come to the aid of the townsfolk, <CHARNAME>.~
@18   = ~<CHARNAME>, this man had killed your father. Would you let him get away? Surely, his plans are thwarted, but he lives still.~
@19   = ~<CHARNAME>, not only have you offered much needed help, but offered it in such a manner that it did not offend the man's pride to accept it. This was a lesson to us all.~
@20   = ~I will not allow you to do this bandit's bidding! Defend yourself!~
@21   = ~I am afraid that he might succeed in finding help. We should visit with Charleston, to ward off the bloodshed.~
@22   = ~It is a grave offence to be called a murderer; graver still for it comes from a lowly man.~
@23   = ~Is that what you humans call justice? Executing innocent men on the street by an usurper's command?~
@24   = ~I would follow this boy, if only to tell his guardian that it is not fitting to let the child beg for help on the streets.~
@25   = ~I praise you on your decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@26   = ~Vail, I will be breaking our people's custom in doing this, but... you are a good man. Before you deafen yourself to the spirit, stop disgracing your community by living in the city of humans and paying loose women for what they call 'love'. Run back, my friend, or you might not find a place to run one day.~
@27   = ~You will not stand alone, kinsman.~
@28   = ~You will dishonor yourself by challenging those who do not wish to fight.~
@29   = ~<CHARNAME>, magical trinkets are valuable, but men's respect is ever dearer; it cannot be earned by robbing those you have saved of their prized possession. Think on it.~
@30   = ~Too often quests like this one end with finding a corpse. Those are evil times, indeed.~
@31   = ~My friend, it was a noble deed. I wish that more people were as ready as you to lend a helping hand to the small folk.~
@32   = ~On my honor as a ranger I swear that we will do our best to draw away the worgs, my good woman.~
@33   = ~I will not stand idly, let alone help you to finish off what gnolls have started by torturing this innocent woman! Lady Dynaheir, it is my pleasure to offer you my assistance against these... bandits.~
@34   = ~Firewine Bridge had been built by the elves, <CHARNAME>. It used to be a trading town, until it was destroyed nigh two centuries ago. Two powerful wizards fought a duel nearby, and they had unleashed so much magical energy that they had leveled the houses and changed the course of the stream forever. I would dearly like to see what still remains.~
@35   = ~Your smile is reward enough. It is important to know that somewhere in this world someone is happy.~
@36   = ~Dear lady, we will do our best. And if I may... if a word from a stranger is of any comfort to you - I hope that your husband is well.~
@37   = ~Thank you, my good elf.~
@38   = ~You need not say more, Bjornin. The half-ogres are as good as dead.~
@39   = ~This vile man cannot be let loose.~
@40   = ~*cackles* Stupid elf.~
@41   = ~<CHARNAME>! Are you deaf? The mage is going to kill the nymph! Will you stand nearby idly? At least try to talk the wretch out of such an evil deed - or her death will be on our hands.~
@42   = ~True, you have had an agreement, but this woman's life is worth more than words. Only a blackhearted man can fault you should you break that agreement. But, perhaps, Ramazith can be persuaded to free you from your word.~
@43   = ~So much ceremony in the cities of men... listen to your heart, elf. Does it not tell you to free me?~
@44   = ~It does, but there is still hope that <CHARNAME> comes to <PRO_HISHER> senses before blood is spilt on your behalf.~
@45   = ~Blood... *shivers* blood is awful...~
@46   = ~One does not lock the woman who is his love and life against her will. Let her go, mage, lest you regret ever loving her.~
@47   = ~No, we did *not*, but we will do so immediately. It is so, <CHARNAME>.~
@48   = ~A daring plan, my friend! <CHARNAME>, we *must* free these people.~
@49   = ~This is despicable! These fishermen sent us to murder a child! <CHARNAME>, I will not stand for this!~
@50   = ~I hoped for a warmer welcome for my company, Thalantyr. You once offered me your roof, or have you forgotten?~
@51   = ~Elf! The name was Kivan, if I am not mistaken. Bah! That's a proper treatment for you, if you stand in the corner with your cowl covering your face. But I never thanked you properly... Come, come, I'll show you what I have done with the spear you broke on those bothersome bandits who tried to force their way in. I am quite happy with the way the enchantment has turned out. I do not craft weapons, mind you. Bah! It's a gift. Take it, take it, elf.~
@52   = ~Fair is your temple and full of hope, priest.~
@53   = ~And have you forsaken hope, my son?~
@54   = ~I have hope, but it lies beyond this plane, Kelddath Ormlyr.~
@55   = ~Gaze upon the sun as it rises, elf. It is born anew every morn - here and everywhere in this world... on this plane. Rejoice, for you are blessed by its rays.~
@56   = ~Saesa omentien lle, Drizzt Do'Urden. Pleasure meeting you... I have heard the talk of you among my kin, and I am glad that we met. I am Kivan of Shilmista. I never expected to find a noble soul in one of your kin. I serve Shevarash, yet I would not blaspheme my faith by shaking hands with you, Drizzt Do'Urden. The true blood of Ilythiiry runs strong in you, uncorrupted by Lolth's treachery. Even after 5000 years, goodness still nests in the darkness.~
@57   = ~I know not how many of my kin are born and remain unspoiled by Lolth's teachings. But my father was. It may be that one day we may all come together and walk the surface as friends to all beings of good faith.~
@58   = ~Then Shevarash's labors would truly be complete.~
@59   = ~Shevarash has a grimmer perspective. The thousands of years of hatred that divide our peoples will not be easily forgotten. We must hope, however. With Mielikki's blessing, Kivan.~
@60   = ~Aa' menealle nauva calen ar' malta, Mori'quessir. May your ways be green and golden, Dark Elf.~
@61   = ~A desertion is an act of cowardice, but I cannot help but pity him. And the woman, Lena, has courage enough for two, walking in the woods full of gibberlings, with a wounded man to protect. Let us conceal the man, <CHARNAME>, for her sake, even if he deserves naught but our scorn.~
@62   = ~If you still need a hand with destroying bandits in the area, Jessa Vai, my friend has agreed to help me find their lair.~
@63   = ~Good day to you too, Kivan of Shilmista. I will just... let <CHARNAME> in on some... details. With your permission...~
@64   = ~It's good to see you have taken the ranger in your company. He needs the companionship to stay sane. True heart and passionate soul... and such boundless grief. It scares me to see a man burning himself out so quickly. Take care of him, will you?~
@65   = ~I am glad to see that a sensible woman looks after the elf ranger now. True heart and passionate soul... and such boundless grief. It scares me to see a man burning himself out so quickly. Take care of him, will you? And if you want to chat - ale is on me tonight.~
@66   = ~Now, back to business... do you have any questions, <CHARNAME>?~
@67   = ~I will make sure to count the number of the beasts we slay, and that my companions remember the limit.~
@68   = ~May Shaundakul guide you, friend.~
@69   = ~In my long years of solitude I often wished for a child, Coran. Think well, before refusing the gift this woman has offered to you.~
@70   = ~Kivan... I am not you, and Briel is not Deheriana.~
@71   = ~Sometimes the gift of death is mercy, I know this all too well. But this man was crazed with grief, he was not gone beyond recall. Armed with this knowledge, Corsone did nothing to prevent the death of one he claims was a comrade. Instead, he helped us to slay Osmadi...~
@72   = ~I urge you to press on with your questioning, <CHARNAME>. This death is on our hands, and we will never be able to make amends, if we do not know the whole truth of the matter.~
@73   = ~Shaman, we but walked through the settlement with our weapons sheathed, when your people attacked us. But we will lower our arms, if you lower yours.~
@74   = ~It's too late. Too many have died. Ursa will kill you for that!~
@75   = ~The mage does not seek to release the captive nymph, but only to imprison her again? <CHARNAME>, we will do good, if we free the woodland creature and let her flee these men.~
@76   = ~Poisoned? Our adversary is growing desperate, if he turned from honest steel to Talona's accursed brews.~
@77   = ~Oh, whatever. Let's just get down to business.~
@78   = ~<CHARNAME>, a man can be tortured and killed, but he will keep his honor. A woman who is a captive of brutish savages will be dishonored... I urge you to help find this man's companion, before it's too late.~
@79   = ~Is that how humans seek knowledge? By digging up the burial mounds of their ancestors? I urge caution, my friend; curiosity of this nature oft nests in evil or greedy souls.~
@80   = ~You want us to fall upon a woman like a score of brigands and kill her? You ask an evil thing, Edwin Odesseiron, and have no proof of the woman's taint or trespass against you. <CHARNAME>, we'll do well to warn Dynaheir of this man's plotting.~
@81   = ~Utinu en lokirim! Son of snakes!~
@82   = ~There are too many elves in this mine! Kill him!~
@83   = ~I saw a true artist near Nashkel mines. Prism poured his soul into a carving of rare beauty - and he gave all of himself to bring the stone to life. You, on the contrary, take others' lives, madman, and you have created naught but a garden of fear... they are not statues, Mutamin, they are... dead stone.~
@84   = ~If I have it my way, you will not be speaking at all before the day is out.~
@85   = ~Wait a minute! Lower ya hood, ya scum! Boys, here's Tazok's old friend - that's the one who offed Red Gren! We bring his head to Tazok - we're rich!~
@86   = ~Teven Attacks

I have encountered a portion of the bandits that currently plague the coast. Their leader, Teven, recognized my companion, Kivan... and, I fear, it ended in conflict, and I shall have to find another method to locate their base.~
@87   = ~I will not put down my sword, <CHARNAME>! I would rather sheath it in this man's body. Still, if you want to enter the nest of bandits in disguise, I will stay my hand. But do not expect me to keep silent, when we meet Tazok.~
@88   = ~Your mistake. It's Tazok, who is going to die to<DAYNIGHT>!~
@89   = ~Not anothe' elven spy! Have had enough whining from that Ender! Anyway, pals, you die!~
@90   = ~Where is he?! Tell me where Tazok is, and I will let you go!~
@91   = ~They are no prisoners, <CHARNAME>. Most likely they are bandits who were too unruly even for Chill!~
@92   = ~Thank you, kinsman. I... I know what it means to be captured by Tazok and his men. Do you need healing?~
@93   = ~The worst of it is over, friend. Tazok has forgotten about me for a few days... or prepared somethin' special for my execution and wanted me to be standing for it? Who knows, but in his tent I was safe from his brutes... Mostly.~
@94   = ~You have been lucky, Ender.~
@95   = ~Are you... are you Kivan, by any chance?~
@96   = ~You know of me?~
@97   = ~Your name has been mentioned. Beware, friend, there is a mad dog after you. I do not know more, but just be careful. Vanya sulie... Fair winds.~
@98   = ~I have met the mage, Thalantyr, before. He is a good man, and I will not stand for an assault on him. It is worthwhile to visit him, however, and perhaps trade with him, <CHARNAME>. He will be interested in magical items, if we ever have them in surplus.~
@99   = ~<CHARNAME>, these are Chill bandits that we are pledged to stop!~
@100  = ~Aye, yer right, pointy-eared. I am Cattack, member of Chill. Chill been ordered to attack all fat humans, carrying iron. We do that, we like cause it's fun to KILL!~
@101  = ~Must you have goaded this woman? These killings could have been averted, <CHARNAME>, if we had a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> for our leader.~
@102  = ~You are right in one thing: we have come to put an end to your torturing and enslaving innocent people. As for us being as good as dead... we shall see. We are not starved slaves for you to bully.~
@103  = ~Your old tutor expressed no alarm at seeing our company marching through the sanctuary of knowledge, armed to the teeth. Yet, he quibbles over a man who recited an old scroll by memory. Truly, this is a peculiar library.~
@104  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is no time for careful deliberations: a woman is threatened with torture! I pray that we are not too late already!~
@105  = ~I apologize for my rash words, <CHARNAME>. I should be wiser than to assume that a woman cannot lie, but... *shakes his head*~
@106  = ~Ya goody-goodies be no company for me.~
@107  = ~Kobolds! Fall back, old man, fall behind us...~
@108  = ~Montaron killed my kinsman without any cause! <CHARNAME>, I only wanted to right the wrongs... but I brought you and your companion here. Now an innocent man lays dead by my feet. From now on, I hunt alone.~
@109  = ~No, Kivan, do not go! I am appalled at what Montaron did, myself, and will not have him in my party!~
@110  = ~Whatever, drama queen.~
@111  = ~I cannot sincerely wish you well, <CHARNAME>...~
@112  = ~I bow to you with respect, master artist. You have bonded to a woman you were not destined to know. Your love was a light, bright and pure, which shall shine on many. You gave birth to a thing of beauty, as immortal as the model herself.~
@113  = ~I need a moment to say a prayer to Shevarash. It seems that my sworn enemy is at the arrow's reach at last.~
@114  = ~Go quickly about it, lest we are discovered.~
@115  = ~Of course, elf. I will join my voice to yours for the success of our battle against the brigands.~
@116  = ~I am sorry, Kivan, I'd rather we move swiftly. You can pray all you want, after we are done.~
@117  = ~My Lord Shevarash, here I stand, on the soil that the beast who slew my beloved still walks. There is no desire greater in my heart than to wet it with his dark blood. I ask for the firmness of my arm to match the firmness of my soul. I ask for fulfillment of my vow, I ask for the strike that will bring down my foe. I ask thee to give me strength to fight, and strength to protect those who fight with me.~
@118  = ~I see your need. I shall be silent. Let my arrows sing my prayer for me.~
@119  = ~Do you remember my Deheriana, beast?~
@120  = ~NO! Stay and fight, or I pronounce you a coward... But what have I expected? Tazok is a coward, for any who would torture innocent and defenseless is a coward. This battle is over, but the war is not, Tazok! I will find you!~
@121  = ~Your sworn enemy and half-brother is near, <CHARNAME>. May the gods have mercy on you.~
@122  = ~Strange place you have chosen for us to visit. Is your treasure hunt that important to you that you wish to walk through these halls full of dwarven ghosts? They love the sight of me not, I can feel it.~
@123  = ~The imagination of humans is rather limited... so many houses, and all look like boxes, and are painted gray.~
@124  = ~If they are evil beasts, why ought my heart feel regret for destroying their livelihood over and over? They fight for their homes here, <CHARNAME>, and we are invading, not defending. We will do well to avoid this pass in the future.~
@125  = ~Are we so different - this man and I? He cherishes zombies as his family, and I walk the Material Plane with my thoughts ever turning to the one in Arvanaith. How long will it be, until my longing creates a ghost of Deheriana?~
@126  = ~How long it will be, until I accompany it, and terrify people of sanity? <CHARNAME>, we should find Tazok soon. My time here grows short.~
@127  = ~Deheriana... you have been avenged, mela en'coiamin. Shevarash! Thy will has been done!~
@128  = ~<CHARNAME>... I will stay to help you find the one who killed your father. I pray that we face him soon, for it takes all my strength to remain on this plane...~
@129  = ~That's enough, <CHARNAME>. We will endanger the colony, if we continue hunting.~
@130  = ~Kill them! I am expected at the mines, and have no time for this shit!~
@131  = ~Tazok has recognized Kivan, and our plan to infiltrate the bandit's camp has failed.~
@132  = ~The elf's head is to go on the pole in front of my tent!~
@133  = ~Kivan and Tazok

Unsurprisingly, my companion Kivan was recognized by Tazok, but he did not get his chance to skewer the half-ogre. The bandit was apparently too busy to deal with the revenge-crazy elf. Tazok is travelling to a mine site. This mine site could be the home base of whoever controls the bandits.~
@134  = ~Tazok Recognized Kivan

Tazok has recognized Kivan and our plan to infiltrate the bandit's camp has failed.~
@135  = ~Now, isn't that our walking dead at last? And with a company of pathetic fools like himself, no less.~
@136  = ~Leave my friends out of it, this is between you and me. Today is the day you die, Tazok!~
@137  = ~Oh, your screeching voice makes me shiver! You have pestered my soldiers long enough, scum! I am going to put an end to it, and I am going to do the job properly.~
@138  = ~Tazok Recognized Kivan

Tazok has recognized Kivan. Our only hope to infiltrate the bandit's camp now is to kill the fiend. Kivan would like that, I wager.~
@139  = ~Lo! Tazok was found dead. By Mask, he'd have our hides, if he'd get lucky again, and 'em bosses in the Gate'd order him patched up...~
@140  = ~But who're ya? Ne'ver seen ya before... Bah, I'm in no mood to ask questions. Nobody'd spend pretty penny on raising me up.~
@141  = ~So, sorry, pal, but ya've been just promoted to murderers. HEYOOO! I found Tazok's killers! HEYOOO!~
@1001 = ~Tazok! Finish this!~
@1002 = ~He'll thank you for it, I'm sure.~
@1003 = ~Show me an innocent man, and I'll spare him. In the meantime, keep your damn mouth shut!~
@1004 = ~Yes, well, thank you, and farewell.~
@1005 = ~Then we stand together!~
@1006 = ~You have the scroll! If you are not content, I will fight.~
@1007 = ~I am, and thank you for your help!~
@1008 = ~This is a rare find, elf!~
@1009 = ~What?! What are you doing here?~
@1010 = ~Just be careful. Farewell.~
@1011 = ~Thank you for your aid, nonetheless.~
