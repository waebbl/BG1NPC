@1    = ~One must start somewhere. The troubles that plague the Coast have become mine, and I shall pursue them as I may.~
@2    = ~That is no concern of yours. Since I am on the road, I will walk it freely. How about you?~
@3    = ~Feel free to depart, if you wish.~
@4    = ~I may as well stick to ye, then. Them bandits be bidding fair to hem me in as well.~
@5    = ~I ain't so keen on walking for its own sake. But I reckon I'll be broke if I can't walk where and when I want, so I'll keep step wi' ye this time.~
@6    = ~Nah, that's all right. ‘Tis rummy business hereabouts, and at least you're willing to try it on.~
@7    = ~My caravan's destroyed, and the Silvershield's pup is dead. Here's a fine to-do! Th' last o' me funds is a kite's breakfast ‘n' me customer ain't gonna be one whit pleased by it!~
@8    = ~Do you suppose there is a connection between these bandits and the iron raiders?~
@9    = ~You are avenged, at any rate. You can return home now and tell the tale.~
@10   = ~Unfortunate. What will you do now?~
@11   = ~Nah. Weren't shippin' no iron. These here jackals musta just come snufflin' around th' blood them iron crews've shed.~
@12   = ~In that case, our goals are the same. We can continue to pursue the bandits and their masters together if you would.~
@13   = ~Considering the mess you've made of things so far, it would be better if we parted company ~
@14   = ~I could. Better not, though. Revenge ain't gonna mend matters none at home, so best I stay out ‘n' about ‘til matters get shook out some more.~
@15   = ~In that case, our goals are the same. We can continue to pursue the bandits and their masters together, if you would.~
@16   = ~Considering the mess you've made of things so far, it would be better if we parted company.~
@17   = ~Well, I could go home ‘n' starve whilst bein' reproached by the bereefed next o' kin. Or I could stay out ‘n' repay them iron boys a bit o' what I owes ‘em.~
@18   = ~In that case, our goals are the same. We can pursue them together if you would.~
@19   = ~So says I. Ye be at least as fine a target fer they arrows ‘n' spells as what I am.~
@20   = ~Suits yerself. Just hope I don't trip too hard over the corpse they'll make o' ye.~
@21   = ~I hands it to ye, <CHARNAME>. Ye don't look like much, but ye *have* got the knack.~
@22   = ~Oh? What knack is that?~
@23   = ~Why, of minding other folks' business and making it pay. Ain't a finer trade in the land than that.~
@24   = ~I prefer to render the ‘payment' these villains deserve, rather than to extract any.~
@25   = ~I don't intend to keep an accounting ledger on this. Any goods will be used to further our efforts or sold for gear, which we will surely need before long.~
@26   = ~I've noted the quality of adherence which gold develops in the vicinity of your palm. Don't overdo it.~
@27   = ~Aye, ‘tis more blest to give than receive, ‘tis said. So ye give them what they deserves, and I'll do the low-down job of taking what they won't miss no more, anyways.~
@28   = ~‘Tis the right way of making good in the world, doubling up your investments time and again. I just hopes we can cash out in good style by the end.~
@29   = ~No fear. I would not lose it as them dead ones we took it from did, so spend if ye must.~
@30   = ~Oof! Here's our wood then. Fire'll be hotted in no time.~
@31   = ~That... that is green wood. Cut from a living tree!~
@32   = ~‘Tain't no brush nigh. ‘Twill burn and so serve us.~
@33   = ~The purpose of the forest is not to serve *us*! You have grievously wounded a living child of nature!~
@34   = ~Stand back ‘n' freeze then. Or, if ‘twill soothe yer achin' heart, I'll cut down the rest o' him so he don't suffer no more.~
@35   = ~You are more savage than the cruel despoilers whom we hunt!~
@36   = ~Thankee, ma'am. Water's aboil. Would ye care fer some tea?~
@37   = ~Hey, longshanks, is it truth that your lot fights for the honor of bringing' justice to the oppressed?~
@38   = ~Hmm... I had not expected such an interest... but, yes. A trifle crudely put, but a fair summation.~
@39   = ~Excellent! Ye take your honor and glory and such, this trip, and I'll mind the gelt!~
@40   = ~Hold! We are not brigands, to take at sword point. Gold has its role in the Order as well.~
@41   = ~Tchah! Should of knew ‘twas that way with ye. ‘Twere best to kept silence and saved me gums.~
@42   = ~Ye, lass. Don't ye think it time ye hived off to your country for some romp with your bunny rabbits and daffydills?~
@43   = ~Oooh, not *quite* yet. There's so much more to see – and do – in the city.~
@44   = ~Mind your doings better, then. Had me a dream, last sleep, as was ten small fingers skittling ‘round me purse. ~
@45   = ~Really? I had a dream once where I picked a dandelion, blew it away, and it played the most lovely music.~
@46   = ~‘Tis fact? Well, I sleeps that poorly as *your* tune'ld wake me entire – if ye gets me drift.~
@47   = ~You poor man. I promise not to dream out loud around you, all right?~
@48   = ~Say, missus, am I ken ye aright, your god sounds the right sort, battles and all.~
@49   = ~Really? You surprise me. I had thought your interest in conflict to be purely mercenary.~
@50   = ~Oh, I don't mind a bit of gold for me pains, but a good knockabout's no bad thing to itself. Keeps a body able for times as will pay.~
@51   = ~Bah! Tempus will not be served with a mere utensil. One worships with striving, daring and pain.~
@52   = ~That being so, I'd of thought he'd grant his preachers a bit of an edge in the down-n-dirty. He don't though, seemingly.~
@53   = ~An ‘edge' would be blasphemy! My Lord Tempus requires all that is in one. To ask for more, simply to spare oneself - that would be abominable!~
@54   = ~Cripes! You're loopy even for a tall one.~
@55   = ~Ho, there. Ye knows your ten-finger discounts, if I'm not mistook.~
@56   = ~Merely undisclosed, anticipatory loans, if you please.~
@57   = ~Hmph. Just bear in mind that your place is in back with your bitty arrows and such. Ye've no call to stand down front where I be.~
@58   = ~Ah, but corpses do offer such advantageous terms. As well as other blessings such as absence of speech.~
@59   = ~Good point. Ye've nigh persuaded me to act on your advice. And I'll see to me backplates afore we're a day older, too.~
@60   = ~A sound program for the faint of heart.~
@61   = ~We'll just see who faints first, won't we?~
@62   = ~If that blasted whelp does not shut up! I am going to tear its darned head off its shoulders!~
@63   = ~Hush! You are disturbing Namara with you pointless curses.~
@64   = ~I AM TALKING ABOUT YOUR STUPID DAUGHTER, WET NURSE!~
@65   = ~Then please choose more considerate terms, it may affect her sense of self-esteem later on, if you continue to be so rude in your descriptions of her.~
@66   = ~Whatever. Just *shut* her bloody mouth up! ~
@67   = ~If the child stutters, I am holding you responsible!~
@68   = ~If she keeps yelling for another minute, you are going to have to hold me responsible for her missing a head! ~
@69   = ~Begging pardon, mistress, but ye find yourself far from home, do ye not?~
@70   = ~Indeed, we art, but ‘home' is small. Faerun is large. ‘Tis well to learn somewhat of lands beyond the border.~
@71   = ~Um-hmm. But I've knowed a scholar or so. Their way of learning ain't yours by a long sight and more.~
@72   = ~The content of a course of learning determines its method of study. In our case, Minsc and I do search to know ourselves as much as any other knowledge.~
@73   = ~Ha! Your pal could find a whole pack of pet rats, then, and still won't be done, I'd venture. Ye, though. Ye sees your way back already, beseems.~
@74   = ~It doth please me that my uncertainties show not. Be assured, however, that I be not more wise nor foresighted than the Wise, to know the future, as you deem.~
@75   = ~Weren't asking for a palm-reading or such-like foolery. I meant that ye ken more of what you're about than your telling, is all.~
@76   = ~As do we all, I should say. But autobiography maketh a tedious narration, doth it not?~
@77   = ~Say, red-spell, ye be far from your kin, are ye not?~
@78   = ~...~
@79   = ~Ach! Don't play deefened on me. I seen ye twitch. If ye've no wish to answer, say as much like a man. ~
@80   = ~(If I respond, this toad will croak again. If I do not, it will croak the louder to prove to itself that it truly exists.) *sighs* I was merely considering how best to express myself in terms comprehensible to you. That is *not* the work of an instant for one such as I.~
@81   = ~Ah, slow on the uptake is ye, then?~
@82   = ~Fortunately for you, I am very slow to ‘uptake' umbrage at crude impertinence. As for your original inquiry, the compass of the Red Wizards spans far beyond mere physical distance. More you are not entitled to know.~
@83   = ~Ah, I get you. Ye dunno yourself why ye're here. Could of been, they put ye so far off on account of your cheery manner.~
@84   = ~Know then, O Ignorance, that where *I* stand, *there* is the center of the most arcane thaumaturgy of Thay. ~
@85   = ~Must be, then, they's all hiding invisible under yer shadow. Clever fellers at disguising themselves, I'll allow.~
@86   = ~Objectively, I suppose you, personally, are not to blame. The fault lies with whomever taught you to speak without granting commensurate capacity for ideation. I must see to that one day.~
@87   = ~I must admit, redbird, I have no strong liking for magic, but yours offers some... choices.~
@88   = ~(Oh, great. The short one is talking to me.) Well, I am extremely content you take pleasure in watching me destroy my foes.~
@89   = ~It's ‘friends' I'm considering, though. What do you say we do this rag tag bunch and split the loot? You can buy some new robes, and I get me a new axe.~
@90   = ~What makes you think I would need your help to deal with them? Moreover, should I wish assistance, what reason would you suggest for trusting *you* to provide it?~
@91   = ~Since I am still here, even as simple a mind as yours could comprehend that I have no present intent to discard my present companions. (Although an exception could always be made.)~
@92   = ~Well, I suppose I *could* warn our companions about what you're planning.~
@93   = ~That would be difficult, since you have no concept of my goals. Or do you imply that, having failed to enlist me in your hare-brained treachery, you intend to accuse me of it instead?~
@94   = ~*Now* ye're thinking! That's exactly why we should work together. We're the only smart ones in this lot. Everyone else would rather build a charity home for orphan bunnies or the like.~
@95   = ~Hmm. I anticipate the gains from such an alliance would be far greater in the foreseeable future. Perhaps later... (Perhaps later I shall grow less careful about placing my fireballs *ahead* of this unreliable midget.)~
@96   = ~Ha! Got to admit, “Sir Lance-a-lot”, I always thought of the man-side as the buyer. Ne'er struck me afore as what we got could be sold, too.~
@97   = ~Pshaw, my dear fellow. The exchange of felicity keeps no accounts.~
@98   = ~Who be this Felicity, then? Your sly-doxie for fun?~
@99   = ~Ha, ha. No. What I meant is that the union of two souls in the ecstasies of romance is no sordid commercial affair. You could not put a price on it.~
@100  = ~No, *I* couldn't, for fair. I could put a name to one as has, though and a handsome sum to boot.~
@101  = ~Your tongue is sharper even than your axe, and wounds more deeply. I value the merest glance from my beloved above all the riches of Faerun.~
@102  = ~Have it as ye would. You must have quite a stock of that blarney, though, to waste it on *me* instead of saving it all for your dolly-bird.~
@103  = ~Young feller, can ye truly be as simple as to care for naught but chanting rimes ‘bout what goes on under your nose?~
@104  = ~I compose tales of our deeds so that others can hear about what we've done. Why would that offend you? I'd have thought you'd like the attention.~
@105  = ~I've heard your rubbidge, don't forget. Naught in it of sweat nor pain nor blood.~
@106  = ~Why would you want to hear about sweat, pain or blood? Gee, they aren't very inspiring. I'd rather talk about our achievements - the things we want to be remembered for.~
@107  = ~Ah, I've no mind to grudge ye your bemusements. I'd be happier in your company though, if ye'd show yourself a bit more forward in dealing your super-feeshuls to the next lot of orcs we meet.~
@108  = ~Ah, well, thanks. I guess.~
@109  = ~‘Tis odd when thought on, missy. Ye and <CHARNAME> claim to of been raised in a grand library, but I'll take an oath I never seen a less bookish pair than the two of ye be.~
@110  = ~It's true, though. But the books were for scholars. As children, we worked more than we read.~
@111  = ~Sounds too practical for bookish fellers, that. And strange work it must've been too, seeing the skills ye both took away from the place.~
@112  = ~*giggles* We were there all our lives, you know. Lots of time to learn all sorts of things.~
@113  = ~Like ‘Dipping in Five Easy Steps', eh? Might be I'll visit there sometime. Seems it ain't nigh as dull as folks make it out to be.~
@114  = ~Ye know, missus, I heard of Harpers but never seen one. Could not say ye impress overmuch.~
@115  = ~Impressing *you* is hardly the liveliest of our concerns.~
@116  = ~I daresay not. Nor was I asking for banners nor trumpets and such. Just wonders how your lot gets on in a general way, is all.~
@117  = ~As any dedicated persons may: by devoting what time one can spare from the true calling to our trades and crafts.~
@118  = ~No cellars full of gold, nor chests of gems to sustain ye through the thin times, eh?~
@119  = ~Certainly not! Any who valued accumulations of such dross would cease being a Harper.~
@120  = ~Ye must suffer a fair drop-out rate, then. To judge by what I can see, at least.~
@121  = ~By all means, continue to judge by what you can see. It is our greatest surety.~
@122  = ~Druid, why do you care so much about these damned forests?~
@123  = ~Unlike you, I can see beauty in other things besides gold.~
@124  = ~Bah! ‘Tis just so useless! All it does is make us waste time in clearing afore we can build.~
@125  = ~For someone whose race lives within mountains, another part of nature, I'm surprised you would say something like that.~
@126  = ~Ye think them holes come ready-made? Spend a childhood hauling slag out the back door, and ye'll learn better.~
@127  = ~In case you haven't noticed dwarf, nature is everywhere. Even in the bowels of the Underdark, there are plants that grow.~
@128  = ~Oh, I've *noticed* all right. Just thought ye might have a better way of fixing it, so a body could live on it but ye be that stubborn, ye wouldn't share it if ye knew.~
@129  = ~Ye know, I'd a sworn ye was a practical fellow.~
@130  = ~Wh-what do you mean?~
@131  = ~Well, a sell-sword whose jolly-bird flies beside him, and can swing a blade, toss a stone or patch her man up at need, a fellow like that'd seem to have his needs well-looked after.~
@132  = ~P-put that way... but you must know that I married Jaheira for the p-person she is. Not as an assembly of adventuring abilities.~
@133  = ~Now that's just what I was getting' at. I try talking sense, and ye comes back to your ‘theeries'. Same like with your Harper nonsense.~
@134  = ~What have the Harpers to do with my wife?~
@135  = ~Same approach from ye for both. Start somewhere that ought to give a nice steady profit, and ye chuck it away in the name of duty or love or such like as can't be seen, nevermind eaten, worn nor spent.~
@136  = ~I see. Leave me to my foolery, then, as you d-deem it, and there will be more for each of us of what we t-truly desire.~
@137  = ~Fair enow. Don't suppose I got to understand to stand besides ye.~
@138  = ~Ye may not credit me, elf, but I like ye.~
@139  = ~You are correct. I do not credit you.~
@140  = ~‘Tis so, all the same. Ye keeps yer mouth shut, yer hands to yer own property, and yer shafts are true. Puts ye leagues ahead of yer kin.~
@141  = ~Then I shall resume that silence which you value so highly.~
@142  = ~I've never seen a bloodthirsty elf before. I'd enjoy it more if yer reasons were better, though.~
@143  = ~What would you know of my reasons?~
@144  = ~Har, I know enough. Ye missed the chance at that camp. If ye had waited just a day or two more, Tazok'd have returned. Of course your head would get bashed, but maybe you could have gotten a hit or two in, slowed him a bit for the rest of us.~
@145  = ~Shevarash will guide me to my sworn enemy. My hunt is long, but I will slay Tazok sooner or later. My life was given back to me to avenge Deheriana. After that is done, I will not linger here for long myself.~
@146  = ~That's what I meant about yer poor reasoning. If living well be the best revenge like they say, ye have to live first, and that goes far better for having the gold to live *on*.~
@147  = ~Kagain, you knew neither love, nor loss. You would not understand me, and I would be truly scared if I thought you did.~
@148  = ~So be it. I'll even set aside a couple bob for yer funeral.~
@149  = ~Oh, hamster! Could ye persuade your person to get a move on? Him standing there, counting the air, don't get us no further.~
@150  = ~Uh... what... oh. Boo informs me that you have said something. It is rude to address Boo directly. Especially you, for Boo doubts your commitment to stomping your feet on the neck of Evil.~
@151  = ~I only suggested that ye begin stomping yer foot anywhere. Ye're like to take root as ye were.~
@152  = ~Oh, I am sorry. The contemplation of thoroughly butt-kicked Wickedness had transported us.~
@153  = ~Transported, eh? Not so well that yer feet wouldn't do better. Let's move.~
@154  = ~It's been awhile since I've had a nice, juicy piece of meat, Minsc.~
@155  = ~You didn't like the ranger soup Boo made before?~
@156  = ~I just think that Boo could do much more for cooking. Have ye thought about giving him a nice warm bath lately?~
@157  = ~Boo does not like your tone, dwarf.~
@158  = ~I'm no bard, so me tone is neither here nor there. But that rat is just a waste of seed. Let me put him to some use.~
@159  = ~Minsc would be nothing without Boo! Without Boo, who would tell Minsc whose butt to kick?~
@160  = ~Hmmm, so that's the reason why you keep him so close. Let's talk again, big one. I might have a nice job for one such as yerself.~
@161  = ~Minsc, how would ye and Boo like to take on a job for me?~
@162  = ~What would you have Minsc and Boo do?~
@163  = ~Boo has been talking to me, and he says that ye would enjoy helping me with some of my work.~
@164  = ~Boo has not spoken of this to me. Are you sure?~
@165  = ~Oh, yes, quite sure, he said ye should help that kind dwarf give a butt kicking for goodness.~
@166  = ~Boo says he doesn't remember saying any of this.~
@167  = ~Boo was quite sleepy when he said it. Perhaps he forgot?~
@168  = ~No, that cannot be! Boo can remember anything and everything.~
@169  = ~Minsc, what profit is there for ye here? Ye can earn some nice gold working for me.~
@170  = ~Boo says I shouldn't trust you.~
@171  = ~No one asked ye to trust me entire. Just once a month on payday and even then ye should count your wages.~
@172  = ~*mutters darkly* Cursed rat! Just boil the damned vermin and be done with it.~
@173  = ~So, ye say yer Zhents are just simple merchants, eh?~
@174  = ~Yep.~
@175  = ~Seems to me, yer pal there ain't the best advert for yer lot. Don't inspire confidence, ye see.~
@176  = ~Hmph. This ain't no sales campaign, is it? Market research, mebbe.~
@177  = ~Ah, gotcha. If ye kin drag yer ‘boss' through in one piece, the Coast might be worth a longer look, eh?~
@178  = ~Dunno. Me own job's to make sure we don't get blamed for nothing we *ain't* done.~
@179  = ~Well, betwixt ourselves, I wouldn't mind if more come of it. Dealing regular with one steady group would have to better the mob of ‘noble' pissants we got here now.~
@180  = ~Then put your back into your axe-strokes, and we'll live to see, won't we?~
@181  = ~Head for the gold, me boy, and ye'll never go far astray.~
@182  = ~Aye. If gold's the need, there's always a rich man's purse to hand.~
@183  = ~Bah! The rich don't carry their true wealth in their purses. Ye wants to deal with repeat custom, after all. That means an organization implementing procedures regular-like.~
@184  = ~Heh! Yer sound like another guy – he's a one fer business method and procee-zhurs.~
@185  = ~A... uh... gentleman of the Zhenterim? Ye know, I've always considered my independence as beyond price.~
@186  = ~And he's always natterin' ‘bout “gen'rous subsidies to start-ups” and such like.~
@187  = ~Send him ‘round, then, send him round. Never hurts to talk to a body, does it?~
@188  = ~Tell me, nuncle, why d'ye rattle on so? Makes ye seem rather an elf than any fellow of sense.~
@189  = ~Perhaps, Kagain, your misconception on this issue is due to the elves' appropriation of that intellectual detachment which I have, in my genius, achieved. Oh yes.~
@190  = ~Ye be ‘dee-tatched' sure enow. Guess that's why we met ye at the gate-walk with your thumb in the air.~
@191  = ~I wasn't just holding my thumb in the air! As is typical for one of your dwarven kind, you confound outer appearance with inner reality.~
@192  = ~The observation of the ebb and flow at the gate offers a mine of insight – to one capable of such activity such as myself. (Heh, no way he understood all that!)~
@193  = ~For truth? And what did ye learn there, then?~
@194  = ~What? Ah, why, that my unmatched intellect and amazing talents were better employed elsewhere, of course.~
@195  = ~I guess <CHARNAME> knows what's what and all, but I'm dead and damned if *I* sees the need for a dip in our midst.~
@196  = ~Poor little fellow! Are you afraid I'll eat the apple off your head?~
@197  = ~Ye be lank enough for it. If ye find such a fruit up there, help yourself.~
@198  = ~Don't fret. I prefer to dine off more... appetizing... dishes.~
@199  = ~Your appetites be clear fer certain. Just recall that ye wish to fill them tomorrow as well as today.~
@200  = ~I got to admit, I be pleased to find another in this company to share the down-n-dirty with.~
@201  = ~Weakling! Do not dare to compare yourself to me!~
@202  = ~Weakling I am? The fellow as butchered that last batch of critters; must of been someone, just looked like me, then.~
@203  = ~Bah! You are weak as all men are – through your lusts. Yours, for gold. Another's for women, or the ease and plaudits of fame. All of you are worthless!~
@204  = ~Hmph. Ye be steady about proofing that theory of yours, we'll all be just fine, then.~
@205  = ~So. Here be the pretty bit yon bard were fretted over, eh?~
@206  = ~Do you know, I rather dislike hearing my beloved's devotion spoken of in such crass terms.~
@207  = ~Why so? It sticks out a mile what the game is. He sings and ye dances.~
@208  = ~You... dare! Dare to speak of our love as though it were a... sideshow in the marketplace!~
@209  = ~Heh. There be markets for yer show, too. I be curious to find how ye does for yerself there.~
@210  = ~Then be informed, base peasant, that my love for Eldoth is *not* an article of commerce!~
@211  = ~Spoke like a rich one, who knows a coin only in the spending of it.~
@212  = ~So, Great one, goin' to be any room for the poor merchant in yer empire?~
@213  = ~When Tiax rules, all will belong to Tiax, so trade must cease. Those who survive, will do so by his sufferance, and subsist upon his charity.~
@214  = ~Thin times ahead, sounds like.~
@215  = ~Begone! Your petty tradesman's concerns sully the Magnificence that is Tiax. There is no sign of the Understanding about you.~
@216  = ~I'll take that as good news, at any rate.~
@217  = ~Tiax, could you shut your damn mouth for once?~
@218  = ~Tiax rules all, Tiax will talk for as long as Tiax wants.~
@219  = ~Well, talk sense if you must flap yer gums. How do ye serve Cyric by ruling all?~
@220  = ~Nobody rules Tiax! Tiax rules Tiax, and Tiax will rule you all. You are just grease under my wheel.~
@221  = ~But if... augh! I be as mad as ye be, trying to talk sense to ye.~
@222  = ~Tiax no longer wishes to talk to you. You will now worship Tiax silently.~
@223  = ~So, a dark elf, in the flesh. Ye don't look so fearsome nor treacherous as is told of ye.~
@224  = ~Is that why you slept not an instant on my watch last night?~
@225  = ~You feared to be taken unaware by my kin?~
@226  = ~Just did cross me mind that ye be not the lone, lost waif ye claims.~
@227  = ~Then compose yourself, timorous wretch. Were I indeed a spy for my people, your beating, bleeding heart would already adorn one of our altars.~
@228  = ~Perhaps. I'd just hate for mine to be the only one in such a state at the end of the day.~
@229  = ~Elf, ye been lamenting without cease since we met. Has it cross'd yer mind that just *maybe* this affair of <CHARNAME>'s ain't going to end as ye foretell?~
@230  = ~No.~
@231  = ~Well, ye be doing your best to make a prophet of yerself. If ye be so afeared of succeeding, how came ye to make the attempt?~
@232  = ~Disaster will overtake us whether we move or sit still. Rationally, I merely preferred to move in its direction, to minimize the tedium of anticipation.~
@233  = ~Ye will be the most amazed elf in the forest, then, when me and <CHARNAME> pull this one off.~
@234  = ~Minor victories are the most treacherous deceptions of all. They blind us to the great and final defeat around the next corner.~
@235  = ~Best to be blind, then, and next best to be deaf in yer company. Since I ain't, I may arrange for ye to become dumb, if ye don't clamp yer cakehole.~
@236  = ~That would be more than I hoped for from death: for it to come as a result of *you* doing a ‘favor' for free.~
@237  = ~Xan, I must say yer magic has grown quite powerful. Why, I haven't seen such power in a long time.~
@238  = ~Maybe I'll show you my magic sometime soon, dwarf.~
@239  = ~Ha! Quite a wit ye have, elf. Anyways, as I was saying, yer magic is so strong now, I don't see why ye need keep that toy blade o' yours.~
@240  = ~Why would you wish my blade, dwarf? Only I can wield it, or an heir of my own blood.~
@241  = ~I wouldn't want to use any elven forged blade, but a sword like that could catch a fine price.~
@242  = ~I would rather give my life than see your grubby hands on my Moonblade.~
@243  = ~Fine. Be careful what ye wish for, mage.~
@244  = ~Ye've been silenced. I hope it ain't due to an influx of sense to the head.~
@245  = ~You have, in fact, interrupted a profound deliberation upon the relative merits, as a preservative, of tannin and blackberries.~
@246  = ~Blackberries! What can ye preserves in them?~
@247  = ~Other blackberries, of course. Blackberry preserves are my favorite adornment for toast.~
@248  = ~Wha... ? We be in grief to our ears, spread as far as ye can see, and ye be thinking of breakfast?~
@249  = ~Ah, but I'm hungry, you see.~
@250  = ~As am I, now ye speak on it. Hey, <CHARNAME>! How ‘bout a bite of dinner before too long?~
