@0    = ~Let's see what you have, then.~
@1    = ~Perhaps another time.~
@2    = ~Well, gentles, may I... ack! What've you got there?~
@3    = ~This, sir, is the necromantically preserved essence of...~
@4    = ~It's a necromantic slime ball! Kill the necromancer, if you haven't already, but get that muck out of my establishment.~
@5    = ~But we have... ~
@6    = ~No stories! Out! Out! OUT!!! ~
@7    = ~From the eager look on your friend's face, I assume that you want the ring made? Return in five days, my friends, and it's yours!~
@8    = ~Return in five days, my friends.~
@9    = ~Ah, you are the ones that have the dryad's blood, but no money?~
@10   = ~Tell you what. I'll make the ring as a spec item. If you decide you want it for 500 gold, it's yours. If not, I'm sure I'll find another buyer. Return in five days.~
@11   = ~Ah, you're here for your ring, no doubt. Here you are, and a fine bit of work it is.~
@12   = ~Ah, you're here for your ring, no doubt. Here you are, and a fine bit of work it is. For only 500, this fine item is yours!~
@13   = ~Well, we will take it.~
@14   = ~Forget it. Just show us your usual wares.~
@15   = ~Your ring is ready, but I wager that you still do not have enough gold to pay for it. Well, well... perhaps another day.~
@16   = ~Just show us your usual wares.~
@17   = ~We will come back when we have 500 gold.~
@18   = ~Why good sir, I have in my possession the rarest and most wondrous of items. Here, have a look.~
@19   = ~Ulp! That's disgus... eh... it is finely preserved though. Dryad, isn't it?~
@20   = ~See!?!? See, <CHARNAME>, I told you, I told you!.. ahem. Now, good sir, as my adventuring career comes first (of course it does), I unfortunately lack mundane necessaries to complete this enchantment suitably myself. Can you inform me what else might be required to distil this magnificent essence into a ring, ring, ring, ring-ring-aroooo?~
@21   = ~Well, a mithral ring would serve as a container to receive the magic of your... ugh... specimen. Unfortunately, I have no such thing is stock at the moment, myself. If you were to provide such an ideal container, then... let's see... the scroll, my time... for... nine hundred... call it one thousand gold pieces, I could produce a magical ring to resist enchantments – maybe even cast a minor one – in four... make it five days. Are you interested?~
@22   = ~Oooh! Let's do it! We must! Can we? Can we, <CHARNAME>? Puh-leeeze?!? ~
@23   = ~I don't know. If we find some such... container, then we can think about it. ~
@24   = ~We will! If we must strip the Sword Coast entire to its fundament of bare stone, WE WILL DO IT!!!~
@25   = ~Uh... sure, Xzar. But... uh... that sounds like a pretty big job, so we better get going. Right?~
@26   = ~Absotively!!!~
@27   = ~Huh?~
@28   = ~Oh, sorry. I meant ‘posilutely'... ahhh, let us be at the doing, not this interminable talking about doing! Let us cease to prate and posture...~
@29   = ~Xzar? Shut up!!!~
@30   = ~My sediment precisely.~
@31   = ~Why, good sir, I have in my possession the rarest and most wondrous of items. Here, have a look.~
@32   = ~Well, a mithral ring would serve. Costs three... uh... four hundred to enchant it to contain the essence. With that and your... uh... component, I could create a ring that'd let you shrug off charms, for certain. Maybe even let you throw one back, if I'm undisturbed for the five days labor needed. Let's see... the scroll, my time, it'd cost nine... a thousand gold, altogether. What do you say?~
@33   = ~Ooooohhhh! Could we? Could we, <CHARNAME>? Please, please, please, please, pretty please with gnats on top? Just THINK how it would please Mummy!~
@34   = ~Oh, go ahead.~
@35   = ~Uh, we don't have that much cash right now, Xzar.~
@36   = ~No way. It's nowhere near worth it, and we've got better stuff already.~
@37   = ~We are here... about the ring!~
@38   = ~What's your decision?~
@39   = ~No way. It's nowhere near worth, it and we've got better stuff already.~
@40   = ~Calloo-callay, my beamish boy! ‘Tis done! And it is mine!~
@41   = ~FORGET it!?! NEVER!!! Your meanness is unmatched, <CHARNAME>! I have not been so unjustly deprived since I was denied the award for First Student in Eyeball Laboratory!~
@42   = ~It sparkles so lovely, like little dead stinky fishes on the shore.~
@43   = ~Arrrr! I can't wait! I can't wait any longer!~
@44   = ~AHA! Vindication of my genius, AT LAST!~
@45   = ~To the streets, then! We must absorb the good red gold, as the sponge absorbs wine.~
@46   = ~<CHARNAME>! What, if I might make so bold, is the present status of our financial surplus?~
@47   = ~Dammit! We're fighting for our lives here! Pay attention!~
@48   = ~Uh... lemme just finish up here, and I'll check, OK?~
@49   = ~Still on about that ring, huh? Well, we've got the gelt. As soon as we kill our way clear here...~
@50   = ~There is none and never will be! Not for that stupid ring. Now get to work here!~
@51   = ~Really, <CHARNAME>, had I thought you incapable of dealing with such trivialities independently, I should hardly have permitted you to remain in my company.~
@52   = ~Then cease presenting your impression of a statue in the square and GET BUSY!~
@53   = ~Oooh! You promised. You PROMISED! I'll kill them all for you! Just watch me!~
@54   = ~Pish-Tosh! You may fiddle your drum here if you wish. *I* have more pressing matters to iron out!~
@55   = ~Have we got enough money for the ring now? Are we ready? Can we GO?~
@56   = ~*sigh* Oh, all right.~
@57   = ~I'm a little busy right now. Get back to me, will you?~
@58   = ~Sorry, we're not there yet.~
@59   = ~We'll check when we get back there, OK?~
@60   = ~Drop it, Xzar. It isn't going to happen.~
@61   = ~You have the priorities of a baboon. With an 'oon' at each end.~
@62   = ~Phyeh!~
@63   = ~You are a cruel <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>, without heart or soul.~
@64   = ~Oh, the ring. Let me see! GIVE IT TO ME!~
@65   = ~Sure. Here you go. I'm going to put it on your finger in just a moment. Heh, makes me feel like I got meself a gentle bride or something.~
@66   = ~Sure. Here you go. I'm going to put it on your finger in just a moment. Heh, makes me feel like I got meself a bridegroom or something.~
@67   = ~In a minute. It cost enough, I want to look at it a moment.~
@68   = ~Tough luck being you. I paid, and I'm keeping it.~
@69   = ~Oh, very well. Unnnhhh! That's long enough!~
@70   = ~My ring, <CHARNAME>. I require it... now!~
@71   = ~No hysterical fits? You must really want it. Take it, then...~
@72   = ~I like you better crazed. Bugger off.~
@73   = ~I see.~
@74   = ~My ring. Where is it? I want it!~
@75   = ~I already gave it to you, Xzar.~
@76   = ~Nonsense. Look at my hands. *He shakes his fingers under your nose.* Do you see it anywhere? No?~
@77   = ~Oh! Er... now don't upset yourself, <CHARNAME>. I've taken it off now. See?~
@78   = ~Give me that ring, you lunatic!~
@79   = ~OK, now you've had your fun, give that to me for safekeeping.~
@80   = ~Try that on me, and you're lawn food. Understand?~
@81   = ~*sigh* Why, Xzar, couldn't you have tried that out on a beggar? Or a lamp post?~
@82   = ~This ring is *mine*.~
@83   = ~That ring is *ours*. And *I* want to share it. *NOW*! ~
@84   = ~ALL of us paid for that, and I don't want you wasting its charge on a whim. Give it to me, and you can have it back when you've calmed down.~
@85   = ~Well, its charge is used up today and by tomorrow, you'll be used to it. I hope.~
@86   = ~Of course. Upon the understanding that I may have it back when necessary.~
@87   = ~Heeheehee! I'll never be deceived into the belief that you like lawns again, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@88   = ~Silly! Beggars are charmed by their wants in any case. And a lamp post? *Could* one charm a lamp post? Perhaps to darken on cue? That *is* a thought... ~
@89   = ~Very well. 'Study it quickly'; that would be my advice to you, *dear* <CHARNAME>!~
@90   = ~*That* is one promise I shall not forget, <CHARNAME>.~
@91   = ~Hmm? Oh, yes. It's as dead as a roc now. If it does not replenish itself on the morrow, I shall hold you fully accountable, <CHARNAME>.~
@92   = ~Me?!? Who zapped Montaron, you or me? ~
@93   = ~I did. But *you* should have known I would try some such foolishness and prevented my doing so. Really, <CHARNAME>, I sometimes worry about your impracticality. It is a grave handicap in a leader.~
@94   = ~Stupid dryad.~
@95   = ~Why did not she inform me she was so weak? She needn't have died at all.~
@96   = ~What's got into you?~
@97   = ~That one - reposing soggily over there - I tried this inane ring... and nothing!~
@98   = ~Well, being dead and all...~
@99   = ~BEFORE death, you idiot. The first time this gaud misfired, I thought it chance... just bad luck. But now I'm certain! The dryad, oak or no, was herself too frail a reed from which to form great magicks. I'll have no more to do with this worthless bauble!~
@100  = ~Iron, eh? I believe, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, it's me duty to ask yer to turn out yer belongings.~
@101  = ~Is it your duty to harass innocent citizens over the ravings of an obvious lunatic, officer?~
@102  = ~Not normally, no. But iron's a tetchy subject these days. And you're a shifty-looking lot what I never seen before. So I believe I'm going to insist.~
@103  = ~I'll see you in the Nine Hells first!~
@104  = ~Oh, very well. This madman is disputing my ownership of this ring, but it's innocent enough, as you can see for yourself.~
@105  = ~*To your surprise, Xzar leaps forward and snatches the ring from the fingers of the astonished Fist.*~
@106  = ~My Precious! I thank you, officer, for your able, if half-witting, assistance in the recovery of my property. Come, Montaron! We shall away to pastures new."~
@107  = ~Whew! I believe I'm going to leave this little affair out of me report tonight. That feller's still in the city tomorrow, someone else can have the pleasure.~
@108  = ~I believe that is a wise decision, sir.~
@109  = ~It worked! I DID IT! I, Xzar, the allegedly repellant necromancer, have CHARMED someone! And not just anyone but the homicidal, psychopathic halfling, Montaron!~
@110  = ~I'm hungry. Where's the walrus titties at?~
@111  = ~HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!~
@112  = ~Thanks be to you! ~
@113  = ~Lovely, isn't she? Do you know, <CHARNAME>, I believe I still have - I do! Here it is! - a container that has been specifically enchanted to preserve the blood essence of creatures such as this.~
@114  = ~It's employment would be most apposite at this juncture, would it not?~
@115  = ~<CHARNAME>! I cannot let this Zhent murder a creature of the woods! I do not relish breaking my oath to Gorion, so do not agree to this atrocity!~
@116  = ~I will always stand by Jaheira's side in this.~
@117  = ~Grr! It's long past time that Nature's fury found you, necromancer! Show whose side you are on, <CHARNAME>!~
@118  = ~I will not stand idly, if you should not restrain this evil man, <CHARNAME>.~
@119  = ~Aargh! The small stinky man wants to hurt a beautiful dryad! Boo's shaking in outrage!~
@120  = ~In the name of Good, I will not let you conspire to slaughter this innocent spirit! My honor tells me to defend the forest creature!~
@121  = ~The vileness of his intent is clear, <CHARNAME>. Thou must stop this madman.~
@122  = ~Leave her be. She's not hurting anyone.~
@123  = ~Yeah! Let's do it!~
@124  = ~But... why... you helped me! Why?~
@125  = ~One help for another, blithe spirit. You owe me a life, and I shall use it well!~
@126  = ~No... no... my lifeblood... my soul... I am dying...~
@127  = ~Dryad's Blood

Xzar, my companion, drained blood of a Dryad in the Cloudpeak mountains. She then attacked us, stupid cow.~
@128  = ~Ah-hah! The tree dies, and the crystal glows like burning maggots... I have done it!~
@129  = ~Did you hear that? Isn't that wonderful?~
@130  = ~What? Wonderful that they're going to call a pack of wolves, come and chew our legs off?~
@131  = ~Really, <CHARNAME>! Weren't you *listening*?~
@132  = ~Well, they agreed you collected your dryad gunk effectively. But you already knew that.~
@133  = ~No, no, no! Those were *ghosts*! The first I have ever seen - in an unsummoned, unfettered condition, that is. Their existence here – and their concerns – suggests the whole lyrical cycle of Nature; life to death, death eternally begetting life in an oscillating rhythm of immense beauty and power. ~
@134  = ~Huh? I'd have never guessed that *you* would be so moved by all this.~
@135  = ~Who could not be? Why, do you realize that by a very simple extension of the process with the dryad, I could capture *all* this in... well, I should need a larger container, of course.~
@136  = ~Ah, that sounds more like yourself, Xzar. But tell me, what would be left of these natural beauties after your ritual?~
@137  = ~*shrug* The biggest stones, I suppose. Perhaps little blackened, ashen bits of things. What would *I* care if I could master such power?~
@138  = ~*sigh* But that must be for later. For now, <CHARNAME>, let us continue our travels, our travails and our pursuit of dreams.~
@139  = ~Toor-a-loor-a-loor-ay... ~
@140  = ~Uh... Xzar, what are you looking for there?~
@141  = ~Looking for? Nothing... well, the crushed neck bones of a hanged man would be nice.~
@142  = ~Found anything?~
@143  = ~No... but you may have. That gaud... may I see it? Yes, mithral, I judge... I have seen them before. So useful if I... that is, *we*... should want to enchant anything.~
@144  = ~Is it magical?~
@145  = ~No, not magical... yet. That is its merit. No one has botched it already, you see.~
@146  = ~Either way, it's party treasure. Give it back.~
@147  = ~I think not. You might lose it... or sell it for food at a time when I, personally, am not even hungry.~
@148  = ~ALL treasure is the common property of *all* of us. *No* hoarding.~
@149  = ~Uh-huh. When – and into what – do *you* propose to enchant it?~
@150  = ~Hmph! Here, then! Just be certain – very certain – that it is available when wanted, *dear* <CHARNAME>!~
@151  = ~The 'what' will see to itself. We meet so many delightful creatures such as the one whose sloshy remains even now are staining my footwear.~
@152  = ~'When' will depend upon a bit more silence from yourself; a cessation of your usual silly questions and pointless nagging. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, most days I should rather talk to my socks. Especially the left one, which is becoming rather damp at the moment.~
@153  = ~Just move your stupid foot. Okay?~
@154  = ~I'd rather trust me with it. *You* would drop it in a leprechaun's ear for safekeeping.~
@155  = ~Have it, then. I am actually curious to see what *you* will make of it.~
@156  = ~The 'when', dear <CHARNAME>, shall depend upon yourself. Upon your extremely limited ability to keep silence during another's interval of study and reflection.~
@157  = ~As to 'what'... *Xzar holds aloft the dryad's blood.* This Nature essence will blend wonderfully well with the mineral, if I am any prophet.~
@158  = ~Uh-huh. *I* prefer profit to prophets, myself.~
@159  = ~Don't be silly, <CHARNAME>. Every child knows that there are no such things as leprechauns.~
@160  = ~Don't be silly, <CHARNAME>. I would never embark upon so vital a thaumaturgy without... guidance.~
@161  = ~Why, an artifact to make all living Nature shriek with pain and horror in the face of immanent and irreversible death, of course. Why else would I bother? ~
@162  = ~Alas! Another to mourn. Another to mourn.~
@163  = ~But we cannot. Our sister's spirit is yet enslaved, even in Death.~
@164  = ~It is so. We must inform our mortal friends of this outrage.~
@165  = ~Not hurting? Well, no; but she's not helping us any, is she?~
@166  = ~Eeehh! These mortals be more wicked than the last!~
@167  = ~Dryad of Cloudpeaks

I tried to help a Dryad in the Cloudpeak mountains. Pleasing such nature spirits would normally bring me no end of luck, yet Xzar sort of mucked up the overall impression...~
@168  = ~Oh, termite fudge! She's gone now! *sigh* And so another research effort fails for want of proper support!~
@169  = ~I thank you, though grudgingly.~
@170  = ~I will not stand idly if you should not restrain this evil man, <CHARNAME>.~
@171  = ~Not hurting? Well, no; but she's not helping us any, is she? And another research effort fails for want of proper support.~
@172  = ~You have done as you said you would.~
@173  = ~As... as for the price you have exacted... Directions to the cache, and a cold farewell. Do not stay long in my wood. You are not welcome. You will find the treasure cache in the wolf cave just hundred feet south of my tree.~
@174  = ~Dryad of Cloudpeaks

I have angered a Dryad near the Cloudpeaks, and have been warned out of "her" wood. Xzar with his crazy ideas did not help any. Ah, well, it's of little concern. She also directed me to look into a wolf cave just to the south, where a treasure cache hidden.~
@175  = ~Hi, I am Blackberry.~
@176  = ~Hi, I am Storm.~
@177  = ~Hi, I am Zosya.~
@178  = ~Stay your passage, travelers. We are investigating the foulest murder.~
@179  = ~Yes. These are the ones. I can smell dryad's blood on them.~
@180  = ~You are as careless as you are evil, for we followed you easily from the wreckage of the dryad's tree - the dryad whom you wantonly slew.~
@181  = ~The wretched woman lived in a tree. Without a door, even. How was I to know you'd take it personally?~
@182  = ~You had confessed the crime. There can only be one punishment for killing a dryad and the sentient oak - death.~
@183  = ~I sense that the Great Mother herself is with us in this fight!~
