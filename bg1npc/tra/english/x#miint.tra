@0    = ~Yes, but with Minsc's luck and Boo's intelligence, one can go far!~
@1    = ~Boo's intelligence indeed.~
@2    = ~Oh, and Dynaheir's magics help, too.~
@3    = ~Thou flatter me.~
@4    = ~No! Minsc thinks that his witch... What's that, Boo?... Oh, I see... and Dynaheir's intelligence helps us *a lot*.~
@5    = ~So it appears. *sighs* I wish thou never found the rodent. I am afraid that it would'st make thee forget of everyone else.~
@6    = ~Minsc will never forget Dynaheir. Boo wouldn't let him.~
@7    = ~*sigh*~
@8    = ~Tiax wishes to get that rodent. World domination would be so much easier if Tiax had intelligent helpers, instead of these simpletons.~
@9    = ~I guess it helps to have both intelligence and luck, while it lasts...~
@10   = ~Was that a hamster?!~
@11   = ~A Miniature Space one, sir!~
@12   = ~I see. I think you do need *luck*... and lots of it.~
@13   = ~I wonder if these fools can even make it out the door without getting killed.~
@14   = ~Space hamsters... what idiocy...~
@15   = ~I never said that, did I...?~
@16   = ~But never said that he wasn't... you really like to keep things vague, don't you?~
@17   = ~My impatient apprentice, what would life be if you had an old wizard guiding your every step?~
@18   = ~Now run along, young one, thine adventure awaits!~
@19   = ~It is quite reassuring to know that the path you have chosen, <CHARNAME>, is approved by Elminster himself. But more importantly, his approval comes with a useful word of advice.~
@20   = ~Another Encounter with Elminster
Again Elminster has made an appearance, though he was a little more forthcoming with information this time. He apparently knew Gorion well, and thought him a good man to care for me. He also spoke of bad blood, and a taint that will consume me if care is not taken. What this means, I am not sure. I will heed his warning, though I have little time to dwell on it. He did give me some names, though, of people he feels are trustworthy: Scar of the Flaming Fist and Duke Eltan. I suppose I can believe them if Elminster himself does so recommend.~
@21   = ~It's not nice to steal!~
@22   = ~At least from us! *giggle*~
@23   = ~Now, where did ye get these stupid ideas from?!~
@24   = ~Oh... well... you see, I *am* a "pickpocket extraordinaire" and... oh dear... would you please let go of my arm?~
@25   = ~IT'S NOT NICE TO STEAL!~
@26   = ~But how am I supposed to make a living? (By Mask, my arm really hurts!) *whimper*~
@27   = ~How about *working*, you good for nothing? Guards! Get over here!~
@28   = ~Ahh, Minsc feels his blood begin to boil. His head begin to swirl. His fury begins to rise. Oh, yes, a most powerful berserker rage engulfs Minsc! AND THEN HE'LL CUT YOU DOWN LIKE A WEED, YOU LITTLE PURSE-CUTTER!!!~
@29   = ~*gulp* Mask, have mercy on me! I... I... I see the light! I do, I swear! I'll never steal again in my life! Here take it back! Take it *all* back!~
@30   = ~Now please let me go! Pleeaaaseee!~
@31   = ~Go then, but remember, Boo will tell Minsc if you try something like this again. And Minsc shall come after you!~
@32   = ~Yes, sir! I swear, sir!... Goodbye, sir!~
@33   = ~Why did you let him go? He was a thief, he should have been punished!~
@34   = ~Oh, friend Ajantis, it is good to punish evil, but you see, he was so scared...~
@35   = ~So what? He was a criminal!~
@36   = ~Yes, but the smell of his fear had started to make Boo's eyes water. I must confess, even Minsc felt his stomach starting to react...~
@37   = ~The smell of... Oh, by Helm! That's disgusting!~
@38   = ~Well, most villains are disgusting. This one is now also in need of new trousers.~
@39   = ~I swear I'll never understand you, Minsc.~
@40   = ~That's alright, Minsc doesn't understand himself either.~

@41   = ~Melicamp the Chicken
I brought a skull back to Thalantyr as he requested, and his attempt to restore Melicamp was a success. The young man's body withstood the strain of transformation again, and he seems eager to learn from his mistakes. Thalantyr cautioned that a tragic ending was just as likely, and that care should always be taken in the use of magic, no matter how benign it seems.~
@42   = ~Look, Boo, what a beautiful tower!~
@43   = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@44   = ~Indeed? <CHARNAME>, Boo says we must beware, because blueskinned women await us with poisoned arrows and enth... enthralling voices... err... what does "enthralling" mean, Boo?~
@45   = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@46   = ~Oh, I see! Thank you, Boo.~
@47   = ~That hamster seems to have more uses than mumsie's magic mirror. Hmmm... I wonder how it would taste with mushrooms? (A lot better than the mirror, that's for sure.)~
@48   = ~Minsc can see from here the castle where the foul gnolls keep Dynaheir! Villainy on the bridge, step aside, Minsc and hamster are coming through!~
@49   = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@50   = ~Yeah, you think you big! You want to fight? We take heads anyway, and get lots gold!~
@51   = ~Boo signals we should look out for traps! Just look at the way he frantically scratches his belly! He always does that when traps are around! Or when he has a really bad itch, but I'm sure that's not the case.~
@52   = ~Beware, my friends! Boo says nothing here is as it seems!~
@53   = ~Boo also warns that his keen nose tells him there are a lot of spiders and undead here. And by the smell of sulfur, plenty of explosive traps.~
@54   = ~Err... are you sure it's that, Boo, and not that piece of cheese you've been hoarding in your pouch for the last tenday?~
@55   = ~Sorry, sorry, just checking!~
@56   = ~Hey ya, big lug, tell Boo to stop warning <CHARNAME> about the traps! A girl gotta earn a living too, ya know!~
@57   = ~But Boo could never disarm a trap the way little Imoen does.~
@58   = ~You betcha!~
@59   = ~*whispering* I know you *can*, Boo, but let's not upset our good friend Imoen by telling her that. She hasn't yet come to terms with your greatness.~
@60   = ~You... you wanted to *eat* sweet, fair Dynaheir?!~
@61   = ~"Sssweet" Dynaheirrrr? Argh, if Ingot knew that, the other gnollsss would have lissstened to him. Maybe Ingot can go back and convince them now.~
@62   = ~You shall go nowhere, and you shall never eat Dynaheir! EVIL, MEET SWORD! SWORD, MEET EVIL! RRRRARGH!!!~

@63   = ~Ingot and Minsc

Minsc's witch is being held captive in the gnoll fortress to the west! It seems likely that she is still alive, as her captors apparently banished the gnoll, Ingot, upon well-founded suspicions that he might eat her. Minsc did not like the said gastronome.~
@64   = ~They keep slaves here?! How can someone be so cruel as to deprive others of fresh air and sunlight? This villainy makes Minsc's fury rise like the ocean! ONWARD, MY FRIENDS, AND LET EVIL BEWARE!~
@65   = ~Thank you, sir. We are glad to have honest men like you champion our cause.~
@66   = ~Oh, Minsc knows, Minsc knows! A gnoll! Minsc HATES gnolls! And they smell really bad, too!~
@67   = ~What're ya bellowin' fer? Can't ya speak normally? Made me deaf, did ya.~
@68   = ~Let out the filthy gnolls to let them do evil? Boo's blood boils at the thought! Minsc smells righteous butt-kicking coming! Er... and many other foul smells, too... Yes, Boo, it was very *stupid* of the bandits to lock the whole clan of gnolls in such a small cave for so long.~
@69   = ~Minsc doesn't understand. Why do all these people hate Jaheira so much? She's a nice lady! Maybe a little too bossy, and a bit edgy... hm... actually, she reminds Minsc of Berthe the Unmarried back home...~
@70   = ~What Boo? No, I don't think I want her to pull my ear again...~
@71   = ~Imagine what she would do to us if she knew *we* got Khalid so drunk at the Jovial Juggler...~
@72   = ~Ahem!~
@73   = ~So it was you! Rest assured, we'll have some words on this... later.~
@74   = ~Sometimes I think you do that on p-purpose, Minsc.~
@75   = ~The Great Mother does not care if you understand her or not, bug. It walks Her own course. And so should I, Her servant.~
@76   = ~You enslave poor, innocent, little wyverns?! Minsc shall have to take the boot to your vile deeds, yes sir!~
@77   = ~Not bad boots... Hmm, I wonder if my trainees would leave them, after they are done eating your corpse?~
@78   = ~You enslave poor, innocent little wyverns?! Minsc shall have to take the boot to your vile deeds, yes sir!~
@79   = ~Not bad boots... Hmm, I wonder if my trainees would leave them after they are done eating your corpse?~
@80   = ~They want to eat us?! What kind of vile creatures are these?! And they... they want to eat Boo, too? NO! Minsc shall crush these things, so that hamsters everywhere can be at ease, knowing that Minsc and Boo watch over them!~
@81   = ~Eating hamssstersss? Why? You have more flessssh on...~
@82   = ~Dynaheir! Look, Boo, we found her! Oh, glorious day!~
@83   = ~Now I believe that 'tis truly thee. I would'st never have thought that I would'st be glad to see this... rodent.~
@84   = ~Yes, my witch, it's me! Oh, <CHARNAME>, if you thought that Minsc and Boo and you made a great butt-kicking team, just wait until Dynaheir joins us and unleashes her magic against the evil critters that bar our way!~
@85   = ~C-critters? I'm still b-bleeding from the last one of these "c-critters"!~
@86   = ~C-critters? I thought we were dead for certain, and he calls them c-critters?!~
@87   = ~I can not think of a better name for this scum, warrior.~
@88   = ~You want to kill Minsc's witch?!~
@89   = ~Your witch?! (Of all the adventurer groups in Faerun, I had to ask *these* particular baboons.)~
@90   = ~Yes, MY witch! Begone, sleazy Red Wizard, lest Boo have your eyes!~
@91   = ~Sleazy?! I bathed this morn! (Which is more than I can say about this gorilla.)~
@92   = ~Yes, sleazy! Now go, before I set my hamster on you!~
@93   = ~It's not your call, you overfed... overfed... monkey! (Yes, that will do.) What say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@94   = ~See, wizard, no one here wants your kind around. Now begone, before Boo can no longer contain himself and shows you the might of his warrior spirit!~
@95   = ~Idiot.~
@96   = ~No, this cannot be! All true heroes, hang your heads in shame!~
@97   = ~Wait a moment, good man, Boo is saying something... What is it, Boo? Oh, I see... Aren't you the fellow that sold Boo to Minsc?~
@98   = ~Indeed, I dabbled with pet trading from time to time. May I see him?~
@99   = ~Come, Boo, say hello to the nice old wizard!~
@100  = ~Let me have a look at the little rascal...~
@101  = ~My furry friend, what have thou been occupied with?~
@102  = ~Indeed? 'Tis quite intriguing!~
@103  = ~Of course I shall give thy regards to Mystra.~
@104  = ~Yes, and that thou art sorry about the incident with the slippers.~
@105  = ~Wait a moment! So Boo really is a...?~
@106  = ~You evil man, you shall not touch one hair on her head! Not as long as Minsc and Boo are here to fight for her with teeth and sword!~
@107  = ~I'm sure we can rectify that, you baboon. (Yes, a fireball will do nicely.)~
@108  = ~Sweet, innocent little <CHARNAME>, in the buff, on a bearskin rug. Imagine that, Boo!~
@109  = ~Some of us already have.~
@110  = ~Coran, will you stop that mumbling!~
@111  = ~Stop encouraging him!~
@112  = ~Ah, those were the times...~
@113  = ~What's so funny about that? Minsc used to do that all the time, until Boo explained to him that the sight of a naked Minsc is too much for some people. Actually Boo said it caused "phallic jealousy", but Boo uses hard to understand words all the time, so Minsc has to translate... ~
@114  = ~Minsc, thou shalt not utter another word! I refuse, even, to remember those times! We wert chased out of three towns in less than a tenday!~
@115  = ~Yes, but Minsc also got twelve marriage proposals.~
@116  = ~A refreshing outlook...~
@117  = ~Treacherous half-orc, BOO WILL HAVE YOUR EYES!~
@118  = ~Gah!~
@119  = ~ENOUGH! ENOUGH! YOU'RE DRIVING MINSC MAD! YOU WOULDN'T LIKE MINSC WHEN HE'S MAD!~
@120  = ~Ya better listen to him littl' man. I've seen him tear the heads off of ogres, ya know...~
@121  = ~*gulp* Well, then... ahem... ta-ta, bye-bye, have a nice day and all that!~
@122  = ~Yes, Boo, I'll ask... <CHARNAME>, do you have some apples? Boo says he's got this craving for apples, and...~
@123  = ~<CHARNAME>?! It's you, then! DIE! DIE! DIE!~
@124  = ~That goes to prove that the intellect of an individual is inversely proportional to his size. Look at me, and look at Minsc... QED.~
@125  = ~You oversized monkey, you'll get us all killed someday! (Not that I care about the rest of them, but he might get ME killed!)~
@126  = ~Why the long faces? Glorious battle awaits, and then I'll get Boo his apples. He can wait, you know. GO FOR THE EYES, BOO, GO FOR THE EYES! RRRARGH!!!~
@127  = ~There's something funny about that man... I've never seen Boo's whiskers quiver so.~
@128  = ~Minsc says not to trust them, <CHARNAME>! Look, Boo's getting all jittery and ready for battle! This is a trap!~
@129  = ~Must we follow the whims of a hamster now? A *Rashemi* hamster... (But I think I'll get a fireball ready... just in case...)~
@130  = ~I must admit I agree with Minsc, <CHARNAME>!~
@131  = ~Poor defenseless boy, lost in these woods! We must find him, <CHARNAME>, we must!~
@132  = ~Poor little man, he's as mad as Minsc was before Boo found him. Perhaps we should get him a hamster? That would surely calm him...~
@133  = ~What's that, Boo? ... Yes, I think a chinchilla would do as well. It would match his eyes.~
@134  = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>! Boo tells me that the earth itself here holds great dangers, and he's not talking about worms!~
@135  = ~Yes! This is the place! Onward, we must hurry! Minsc will not let Dynaheir suffer a moment more in this place!~
@136  = ~Onward to rescue our fair lady!~
@137  = ~Heh, how does <CHARNAME> know that Dynaheir is fair?~
@138  = ~*wink* I saw her in my dreams, Minsc.~
@139  = ~I... I think I saw her in my dreams, ranger.~
@140  = ~From your tales, of course, my loyal companion!~
@141  = ~She is not? O, well, I guess we will have to rescue her regardless...~
@142  = ~I do not, but one can always hope, eh? You see, in the bard's songs the damsels in distress always kiss the brave knights who delivered them.~
@143  = ~Really?!~
@144  = ~What's that, Boo?~
@145  = ~Oh, I see... great joke, <CHARNAME>!~
@146  = ~Misnc did, too... But how can <CHARNAME> know it was Dynaheir, not some other witch?~
@147  = ~YES! ONWARD!~
@148  = ~Why would Dynaheir kiss <CHARNAME>? Minsc thinks that if she kisses anyone that would be Boo... Women do that sort of thing...~
@149  = ~Now, Boo, do not get all excited!~
@150  = ~Evil round every corner. Careful not to... Eack! I think I just stepped in some!~
@151  = ~I hope this ship doesn't have rats. Boo HATES rats! Don't you, Boo?~
@152  = ~Cover your nose, Boo! This place smells worse than the Lodge after a three day feast!~
@153  = ~No, I think it beats even that time when Uldon the Unwashed had all those beans and cabbage for supper. But at least we can do something about the smelly villains responsible for this!~
@154  = ~This foul place stinks of evil! Let our righteous wind cleanse it!... Err... I think that didn't come out quite right, did it, Boo?~
@155  = ~Cover your nose, Boo! This place smells worse than the Lodge...~
@156  = ~*ignore Minsc*~
@157  = ~...after a three day feast! I know, I know...~
@158  = ~...after a three day feast! Wait... did not we go to a place exactly like that already? Eh?~
@159  = ~Did Minsc already say that?~
@160  = ~Yes, Minsc, you did...~
@161  = ~Well, it does! Really!~
@162  = ~Minsc shall not allow you to murder sweet Dynaheir! Reconsider, now!~
@163  = ~Very well, Minsc, we'll go save Dynaheir.~
@164  = ~Minsc, I haven't promised anything to anyone. We'll go save Dynaheir. You watch Edwin, he watches you.~
@165  = ~No, I shall not reconsider. Get lost, you crazy pet worshipper.~
@166  = ~Then you shall feel the wrath of Minsc and Boo! RRRARRRGH!!!~
@167  = ~I do not understand, <CHARNAME>, but Dynaheir must be saved. I will watch the wizard, and Boo will watch you.~
@168  = ~Relatively cunning, for such as you. (Suffer these idiots for now, and both Rashemi shall fall under my power.)~
@169  = ~Wizard, no one here wants your kind around. Now begone, before Boo can no longer contain himself and shows you the might of his warrior spirit!~
@170  = ~Hmmm. Seems I shall have to find others more... accustomed to confidential work. Begone! I have no time for this!~
@171  = ~Edwin and Dynaheir

I have met a man named Edwin near Nashkel, and I refused his deal to kill someone named Dynaheir. I shall have to be on the lookout for both of them.~
@172  = ~Oh! Boo has told Minsc of these gooey things! We must use fire against them, <CHARNAME>, or they'll overcome us.~
@173  = ~If only we had Dynaheir with us. Oh, what fireballs she could throw! Greater than Boo after a tenday beans diet.~
@174  = ~Sure helps to have a powerful witch like Dynaheir with us, doesn't it, Boo?~
@175  = ~O flatterer, why would'st not thou step aside so I can cast?~
@176  = ~It was very lucky that we found the chicken-mage and brought him to the wizard! Now he is a man-mage again and we are heroes!~ 
@177  = ~Truly, Tymora loveth a fool. From what I know of the magics Melicamp dabbled in, he should have ended up in a farmwife's soup.~
