@232  = ~When asked about her past, SHAR-TEEL has very little to say.  From the little she speaks of it can be gleaned that she is an orphan. She also seems to harbor an intense dislike for Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as an obvious disrespect for men in general. She seems to have something to prove, and likely her childhood was not of storybook quality.~ [DUMMYSND]

@245  = ~Can't you ever shut up?~
@246  = ~I don't understand just where this hatred is coming from. Can't you see that every person is different, both men and women?~
@247  = ~You are a boor and a blight on womanhood yourself, Shar-Teel. So be clever now and show some respect for your betters.~
@248  = ~So stupid... So proud of her own stupidity...~
@249  = ~I was not the one who started this cretin conversation, you dolt.~

@251  = ~Oh, the flaming Nine Hells!~
@252  = ~You are hopeless...~
@253  = ~It's weakness I hate, and I see plenty in men.~
@254  = ~No one is the better over me, you arrogant fool! And I'd let my sword prove it to you!~
@255  = ~A woman you might be, but as weak as a man in spirit and character! I have no use for you.~

@263  = ~No, I am hopeful. Very hopeful that you shut your teeth, and don't open up your mouth, unless you have something worth saying.~
@264  = ~Men are worse than worthless!~
@265  = ~They are self-centered, and they only have blubber at their core.~
@266  = ~No race has men that are not dispensable.~

@289  = ~They are living proof however that women can take a joke.~

@306  = ~More like high heels, if you ask me: they're easy to walk on, once you get the hang of it.~
@307  = ~Absolutely! Also they remind me of curling irons: they're always hot and always in your hair.~
@308  = ~A dagger? I'd rather use a bastard sword on the bastard.~
@309  = ~You will do better next time. There is plenty man-flesh for target practice around.~
@310  = ~You shouldn't say anything about the dead unless it's good.~
@311  = ~He was a man. Good.~
@312  = ~Huh, I think I missed him, actually, but my aim is improving.~
@313  = ~I found the fastest way to this man's heart: it's through his chest with a sharp dagger.~

@319  = ~And the actors are the worst out of that sorry lot.~
@320  = ~I have no love for swine, but at least pigs don't turn into men when they are drunk.~
@321  = ~They are all swine.~
@322  = ~No, no. Men are not pigs. Pigs are gentle, sensitive, and intelligent animals. Men are just animals!~
@323  = ~All men are bastards, some are just better actors.~
@324  = ~I have seen gibberlings, orcs and many other fabled creatures of legends since I left Candlekeep. But a good man... haven't spotted one so far!~
@325  = ~Nah, that would be fighting. They fight when they want to show off. Pathetic.~
@326  = ~A man who dares to do that is only trying to pull her down to his level.~
@327  = ~They never do, though. Instead they flash their stupidity in your face by talking about things they know nothing about.~
@328  = ~Like women... I am from Candlekeep library, so let me tell you: the thinnest book in the world is what men know about women.~
@329  = ~And they are the most pathetic when they try to deny it.~
@330  = ~They should take lessons from fish. They would not get into trouble, if they only kept their mouths shut!~

@332  = ~And stupid to boot.~
@333  = ~Gods must love fools, indeed...~
@334  = ~Never let a man's mind wander, it's too little to be out by itself.~

@336  = ~Nay, it's when she makes a corpse out of a man, then it's really an improvement.~
@337  = ~Well, I certainly would not be in a search party when it gets lost.~
@338  = ~Since they made so many men... Even the gods can be wrong, and this is the error I like to correct with my sword.~
@339  = ~Yeah, they have their manhood and brain, but not enough blood supply to run both at the same time.~
@340  = ~They have adapted, though... We know where the men's brains are, don't we?~
@341  = ~Huh, that's why most men prefer looks to brains... because most men see better than they think!~
@342  = ~If they think at all.~
@343  = ~Ha, that's why we, women, do not have men's brains! We do not have the accessory to put them in!~
@344  = ~Of course. Men are especially gifted in the areas of stupidity, boasting and whining.~
@345  = ~They make as good meat shields as women.~
@346  = ~Killing these weaklings is rewarding... when they carry fat purses.~
@347  = ~Luckily lots of them join the Flaming Fist, so I can derive double pleasure: not only do I teach a scumbag a lesson, I also slaughter another male pig.~
@348  = ~One Chultian man-eater in Ysena's employ said that men tasted good when roasted with dill and hot peppers.~
@349  = ~Never tried eating men I killed, but I'd take her word on it. What a woman!~
@350  = ~Never saw any valor in the eyes of men who face my blade. *laughs* But then again, it's not their eyes I go for from the low guard.~
@351  = ~You like valiant man? Now I understand why we have to endure the company of that polished tortoise, Ajantis! The only thing that is hard about him is his words!~
@352  = ~Ysena used to say that if a woman thinks that men are brave, her best cure is to tell the one she bedded that she is with child.~
@353  = ~O, please! *She points a finger Khalid's way and snorts with laughter.* Brave!~
@354  = ~And what use is that? Apart from running away in a hurry whenever the battle gets hot?~
@355  = ~Quayle calls himself smart and boasts about having the biggest brain of all men. And you know what? The only thing he proves is that the larger a man's brain, the more it is filled with nonsense.~
@356  = ~Loyal? Oh yes! To the content of their codpieces!~
@357  = ~So? *Nods Kivan's way.* Seems to me that only half-mad men are loyal to tears. You like *that*?~
@358  = ~As useful as an umbrella to a fish.~
@359  = ~Useful like Montaron in a bar brawl? The man is four foot tall and calls himself a fighter!~
@360  = ~Why is it that men waste good gold on whores, when they can rape all they want while pillaging?~
@361  = ~Meaning that they only fight when there is gold in it like Kagain? That's pathetic!~
@362  = ~Wise? These boastful scumbags are *wise*? Shar's blessing, but they'd say and do anything for a chance to show off.~
@363  = ~Right, just like Coran is wise. Ever been to a village that he had passed through and did not have to fight with some enraged boor?~
@364  = ~Huh, I see nothing of value in the round-eyed wool heads wailing songs to the moon or accosting every passing woman with poetry.~
@365  = ~Romantic? The only thing Garrick is marginally good for is that his horrified yells are louder than the screeching of dying xvarts.~
@366  = ~You mean they lie so easily that you can't believe a single word they are saying?~
@367  = ~So, I bet we are about to see you utilizing the latest stinking mixture by Xzar as a weapon? Just damp it away from me *this* time or you will both die!~
@368  = ~Bril-brilliant? *Shar-Teel cannot speak overwhelmed by a fit of laughter. In retrospect you have never seen her laughing so hard.*~
@369  = ~Only in their own sick imagination! Bah, just look at Edwin mumbling his wet dreams under his nose!~
@370  = ~You tried one? Ha, who would have thought that sweat and tears would taste sweet...~
@371  = ~Like Eldoth is sweet with Skie? If anything about this snake is sweet it is his poison, <CHARNAME>.~
@372  = ~Excessive cheerfulness is a sign of lunacy.~
@373  = ~How very accurate! Why, now I know why they say: 'more cheerful than a grave or Xan...'~
@374  = ~Men are the weaker sex, <CHARNAME>. That's all that can be said about it.~
@375  = ~Men are the weaker sex, <CHARNAME>. And if one by some mischance is born strong - well, he ends up needing a hamster to serve as his brains.~
@376  = ~Their heads, or rather their brains are so level that it becomes indistinguishable...~
@377  = ~Gah, perhaps you are right: Yeslick's head is so level that you can spar on top of it, while he is taking a nap in the middle of the battle!~
@378  = ~They could have been if they weren't so stupid - you always end up telling them what, how, when and how long, sis. And that's after all the practice they get by themselves.~
@379  = ~Don't flatter yourself.~
@380  = ~What kind of idiotic answer is that?!~
@381  = ~Yeah. All men are pa-the-tic: it saves a woman both time and effort. Oh, stop creasing your forehead: there is no other word to describe manhood, <CHARNAME>, but pathetic.~
@382  = ~Er... I guess you are right.~
@383  = ~Valiant.~
@384  = ~Brave.~
@385  = ~Smart.~
@386  = ~Loyal.~
@387  = ~Useful.~
@388  = ~Pragmatic.~
@389  = ~Wise.~
@390  = ~Romantic.~

@396  = ~Level-headed.~
@397  = ~Sexy.~
@398  = ~Let us agree to disagree, Shar-Teel.~
@399  = ~Are you a fool or some kind of a blissfully ignorant orphan abandoned in the care of an old monk in a desolate library where normal people are forbidden entry?~
@400  = ~I am a fool.~
@401  = ~I am the... er... the latter.~
@402  = ~Uhm... neither.~
@403  = ~*laughs* I can see that!~
@404  = ~Then bloody see the world before opening your trap!~
@405  = ~*She spits on the ground. It is obviously the only answer you are going to get.*~
@406  = ~I can find a use or two for the stronger ones between the sheets. But they get used up so quickly...~
@407  = ~Men make perfect... corpses.~
@408  = ~Why are you staring at me?~
@409  = ~I have just discovered a new artform, Shar-Teel. These blood glyphs on your armor are quite unique, and oddly fascinating.~
@410  = ~Because.~
@411  = ~I was just looking for weak spots on your armor. In case you attack me again.~
@412  = ~So they are. And they read: "Hail Shar-Teel the Victorious!"~
@413  = ~And I'll be fascinated once you have as many ornaments as I do.~
@414  = ~Fine.~
@415  = ~Shut up.~
@416  = ~Shut up yourself.~
@417  = ~No, you shut up.~
@418  = ~*You think it wiser to leave Shar-Teel the last word.*~
@419  = ~Eunuch.~
@420  = ~I am not, bitch!~
@421  = ~Not for long!~
@422  = ~You'd find none, cur.~
@423  = ~Actually, that seam on your armor looks promising.~
@424  = ~No matter. I'd kill you first, anyway.~
@425  = ~*Shar-Teel notices your interest. As she uncovers the source of it, she grins widely and her eyes gleam with pride. The moment of benevolence is short-lived however, as her grin turns to scowl.* Mind you own business, dolt.~
@426  = ~Have you ever noticed, that no matter how different the blood of various creatures is when fresh, it all turns nearly black once dry?~
@427  = ~Not really, she-bear. Some of it is lighter, some darker. And I've noticed that goblins blood has a greenish tint to it.~
@428  = ~It fits well with your color scheme.~
@429  = ~One day we should go to the Abyss and hunt demons. Their blood must be brighter than that of mere mortals.~
@430  = ~I don't care which color it is. The main thing is that it is not mine.~
@431  = ~Eeew, Shar-Teel... that's so un-ladylike. You should be discussing shades of silk, not shades of blood.".~
@432  = ~Your jaw is going to have greenish tint if you don't leave me alone.~
@433  = ~It fits well with everything.~
@434  = ~See that we do. A demon hunt sounds like something I'd enjoy... even in your miserable company.~
@435  = ~Figures. You're a queasy sort. I hate weaklings that faint at the sight of blood. Look at it, mongrel, and know that yours is no different.~
@436  = ~Silk? Ysena had an assassin who could strangle a person with wisps of silk. *She spits.* The coward was blood-shy, too.~
@437  = ~Your eyes are about to fall out of their sockets. And I'm about to help them along.~
@438  = ~*Shar-Teel arches a proud eyebrow at you.* Didn't know that you enjoyed your own wailing. I prefer the laments of my foes.~
@439  = ~*chuckles* Communing with jackals again, <CHARNAME>?~
@440  = ~Listen, if you have to sing, make it a decent song, not the whining sort.~
@441  = ~*Shar-Teel starts singing a marching song. She generously compensates for the occasional false note with loudness.*~
@442  = ~*Shar-Teel arches a proud eyebrow at you.* I prefer listening to your singing when I fight. It mixes in nicely with the laments of my foes.~
@443  = ~Listen, if you have to sing, make it a decent song, not this whining sort. How about that one you sang yesterday about slaying a thousand orcs?~
@444  = ~*snort* I'm sure that I'd appreciated it more if I were a jackal. Hear how eagerly they joined in with you?~
@445  = ~*snort* I'm sure that I'd appreciate it more if I were a mongrel. Hear how eagerly they joined in with you?~
@446  = ~*Shar-Teel stuffs her fingers into her ears.* I can't believe that I'm saying it, but this is worse than usual!~
@447  = ~O, burn you! I have better things to do then wail.~
@448  = ~*Shar-Teel pays no heed to your words and continues on as before. Satisfied with the cacophony she'd produced, she nods and mutters.* That's how well we sing together, lover-boy.~
@449  = ~*Shar-Teel's voice, just like everything else about her, is strong. What surprises you is that her deep and slightly hoarse contralto compliments your own voice marvelously. You two sing well together.*~
@450  = ~*Shar-Teel laughs with you, almost merrily.* Now I know how to shut you up!~
@451  = ~*points right back* What else did you expect: I was copying you!~
@452  = ~*Shar-Teel takes the necklace gingerly, as if you've offered her a snake.* What a stupid thing to hang about your neck... A well made gorget, now, that's another matter! Maybe I can sell it. *She proceeds to stash the amulet away.*~
@453  = ~Find yourself a whore, if you want a woman all decked out like one.~
@454  = ~I will take what I want from the loot whenever I wish to! And I do not want this... trinket.~
@455  = ~I will take what I want from the loot whenever I wish to! And since that stupid necklace did catch my eye, I claim it!~
@456  = ~What bloody ring? *But a sparkle in Shar-Teel's eye tells you that she remembers very well what ring you are talking about.*~
@457  = ~*Shar-Teel's entire body stiffens in your arms. When you release her, she looks rather shocked, but recovers fairly quickly... Though she does throw more than a few suspicious glances in your direction afterwards.*~
@458  = ~*Shar-Teel appears to take this as a wrestling challenge. She squeezes you in a body hug and the two of you tumble to the ground in a tangled and warmly breathing mass of limbs. While you don't mind having Shar-Teel's weight pressing down against you, she doesn't seem quite as comfortable and breaks the clinch all too soon. After she made sure she'd won, of course.*~
@459  = ~*She knees you in the groin.* Ah - you caught me by surprise, <CHARNAME>. Take a few deep breaths and you'll soon recover. That seemed to work for all the other men, anyway.~
@460  = ~*While you enjoy the close, personal contact with Shar-Teel's body, she appears to have different ideas. As you envelop her in your arms, she twists up and out of your grasp, then punches you gently in the back.* You leave yourself open to attack in such a position, <CHARNAME>. I wouldn't try this too often.~
@461  = ~*Shar-Teel's entire body stiffens in your arms for a split moment. Then she relaxes and leans against you.*~
@462  = ~*Shar-Teel does not pull away from you; she stands erect in your embrace, like a statue. However, you feel her quickening heartbeat, as you press her closer to your chest.*~
@463  = ~Must you do that, lover-boy? *It is difficult to say if Shar-Teel is truly irritated, or pleased, but trying to sound irritated.*~
@464  = ~I'd rather you left this touchy-feely stuff for between the sheets games. It's time for slaughter now, not-~
@465  = ~*Shar-Teel twists herself out of your arms and turns away. Unsaid, 'love' hangs between you, listless, like a banner on a windless day.*~
@466  = ~*A confident grin broadens across Shar-Teel's face, as she offers a grimy hand for you to grasp.*~
@467  = ~*Her palm is rough and calloused, though you hardly have a chance to notice as your hand is quickly crushed in a tight and powerful grip. The look of concentration in Shar-Teel's eyes is matched only by your own determination not to lose.*~
@468  = ~*You plant your elbow into the rough surface of the table and heave with all your strength, though the contest does not stop you from noticing the way Shar-Teel's muscles slowly and rather impressively build beneath her skin.*~
@469  = ~*A confident grin broadens across Shar-Teel's face as she offers a grimy hand for you to grasp. Before long, you are underway.*~
@470  = ~*Your hands are painfully clamped together and you can feel Shar-Teel's hot breath blowing onto your whitened knuckles.*~
@471  = ~*Heave harder.*~
@472  = ~*Squeeze Shar-Teel's knuckles together.*~
@473  = ~*Your grip is slipping.*~
@474  = ~*Release Shar-Teel's hand and kiss her.*~
@475  = ~*Try to break Shar-Teel's knuckles.*~
@476  = ~*Despite your best efforts, Shar-Teel is simply too strong for you. With a final grunt of effort, she slams your fist into the splintery wood and gloats at you from across the table.* That was invigorating, <CHARNAME>. You were always going to lose, but you lasted longer than I expected.~
@477  = ~*You tighten your fist and grind Shar-Teel's knuckles together. She gives a slight grimace of pain, but grits her teeth and redoubles her efforts.*~
@478  = ~*Despite your best efforts, Shar-Teel is simply too strong for you. With a final grunt of effort, she slams your fist into the splintery wood and glares at you from across the table. She rubs her reddened knuckles slowly, as if contemplating how her uninjured fingers would feel wrapped around your neck.*~
@479  = ~I should have known a male dog would stoop to cheating.~
@480  = ~*She stands abruptly, shoving the table painfully into your chest.*~
@481  = ~*Despite your best efforts, Shar-Teel is simply too strong for you. She slams your fist into the splintery table with ease and presents you with one of the most irritating, gloating grins you have ever seen.* Don't cry now, <CHARNAME>. Losing is something you should be used to.~
@482  = ~*Shar-Teel's eyes widen in surprise as you calmly wrench her fist into the table. The surprise turns into a glare, which then melts into an expression of sullen acceptance.* That would be the second time I've lost to you in a battle of strength. I guess I should congratulate you.~
@483  = ~*She pushes away from the table abruptly and stands, looking slightly troubled.* Let's not waste any more time here, <CHARNAME>. We've obviously not been fighting enough lately.~
@484  = ~*With the sudden loss of resistance, Shar-Teel's hand plummets toward the table. You lunge in for the kiss.*~
@485  = ~*Unfortunately, your lunge has left you unbalanced, and your lips instead connect with the side of Shar-Teel's head. The force behind your propulsion was perhaps also misjudged, as you find a significant proportion of your weight making your kiss's landing a heavy one indeed.*~
@486  = ~*In the battle between your lips and Shar-Teel's skull, her skull wins. You fall back from the table, nursing a bruised and aching jaw.*~
@487  = ~*Shar-Teel has not come off much better. She rubs her head in irritation.* You don't have to resort to foolish tricks to try beating me, <CHARNAME>.~
@488  = ~*You tighten your fist and squeeze Shar-Teel's knuckles so that the bones grind together. She yelps in pain and pushes away from the table, then punches you hard across the side of your head with her uninjured hand. She leans over you and speaks in a low, furious voice.* Remind me NEVER to play with cheating male dogs! Useless guttertrash!~
@489  = ~*She spits at you and stamps away. It is clear you won't be getting another chance to go near her.*~
@490  = ~*The moment your fingers make contact with Shar-Teel's well-toned posterior, she turns around and beats you over the head with her sword. Perhaps Shar-Teel has some feeling for you, after all, since she used the flat of the blade instead of its edge.*~
@491  = ~*You black out for a few blissful minutes.*~
@492  = ~*Your head aches for the rest of the day.*~
@493  = ~*Shar-Teel turns and gives you a dangerous look* The last man who tried to touch me without permission can no longer be regarded as a man.~
@494  = ~*You spend a highly enjoyable moment with your hands firmly locked around Shar-Teel's rump. The moment does not last however, as Shar-Teel reaches around and gives YOU a firm squeeze. Right where it hurts.*~
@495  = ~*The smirk on her face shows that she enjoyed that very much as well.*~
@496  = ~*Shar-Teel shies from your grasp, so quickly that you are later unsure just how it happened. You find your fingers locked in an unbreakable squeeze. She stares at you unflinching until you reach the understanding... that there is a time and a place for these actions - and that time is not now.*~
@497  = ~*She absently swats at your fingers.* Curse these idiot flies!~
@498  = ~*Shar-Teel sighs and assumes a bored expression.*~
@499  = ~*Shar-Teel arches her back with the grace of a large feline... the dangerous type.*~
@500  = ~*Shar-Teel shakes her head.* Thank you for reminding me that you have two things in common with ants: the talent for being incredibly annoying and brain size.~
@501  = ~*Shar-Teel backpedals and slides her fingers along your spine. She chuckles as you shiver under her touch.*~
@502  = ~I'm glad that at least ONE of us is happy. Close your mouth, before you start drooling.~
@503  = ~How is it that men can be so content with their lot in life?~
@504  = ~Ah, yes. Stupidity.~
@505  = ~*She grins in return.* Thinking of our next victim, <CHARNAME>?~
@506  = ~*She rolls her eyes.* Men are pathetic.~
@507  = ~*Shar-Teel treats you to a scornful look.* Flattery will get you nowhere.~
@508  = ~*Shar-Teel's upper lip rises in a sneer*. You would do better to prove yourself in battle than trying to get on my good side with mere words.~
@509  = ~*Her expression remains a unreadable as ever. You detect a very slight reddening of her ears - but only because you are watching her so closely for a reaction.*~
@510  = ~*When she realizes you are staring, she glowers at you.* Aren't there *better* things to look out for? Enemies to run through and the like? If all men were as easily distracted as you are, they'd all be long dead, and I, for one, would be much happier.~
@511  = ~*Shar-Teel tosses back her thick, tawny locks.* Well, not *everything* you say is completely stupid.~
@512  = ~*Shar-Teel jerks back from your fingers, her eyes narrow and untrusting.* What in hells are you doing?~
@513  = ~*Shar-Teel's skin is firm and smooth to touch, although the layer of dirt encasing it makes that harder to judge. The skin decorated by her violet tattoo is rougher under your fingers, and at such close quarters you can hear that her breath has quickened. You cannot tell whether this is due to passion or anger. After a moment, she jerks away and glares at you.*~
@514  = ~Touch my face again, and I'll beat you black and blue.~
@515  = ~*Most probably anger.*~
@516  = ~Don't even think of fondling me, <CHARNAME>, unless you like the taste of steel.~
@517  = ~*Shar-Teel smacks you across your jaw with the hilt of her sword in return. The twitters of the birds that subsequently encircle your head do little to drown out her snicker.*~
@518  = ~*Shar-Teel prods at your cheeks with grubby fingers, the jabs going dangerously close to your eyes, as her lips widen in a mockery of a coquettish smile. She suddenly squeezes your jaw in a painful grip.* How do *you* like having your features rearranged?~
@519  = ~*Shar-Teel jumps away.* Idiot!~
@520  = ~*Shar-Teel frowns, but endures your touch.*~
@521  = ~Has some wizard cast a blindness spell on you, <CHARNAME> that you don't know me by looking? If so, go find yourself a priest! I have no patience for this foolery.~
@522  = ~*For a moment Shar-Teel closes her eyes and looks almost peaceful. Afraid that she'd blow up at any moment you take your hand away gingerly. Shar-Teel opens her eyes and glares at you.*~
@523  = ~*Shar-Teel prods at your cheeks with grubby fingers, the jabs going dangerously close to your eyes. Her lips widen in a mockery of some coquettish smile.* You've a smooth face, my boy. Not a scar. Phew.~
@524  = ~*Shar-Teel looks at your hand as if it was diseased, then pulls away with a snort of disgust.*~
@525  = ~*Shar-Teel escapes your grip.* You're wasting a hand that could be used for fighting, <CHARNAME>.~
@526  = ~*Shar-Teel rolls her eyes.* What next, <CHARNAME>, flowery meadows?~
@527  = ~*Shar-Teel nearly pulls your arm out of its socket as she wrenches away.*~
@528  = ~WHY are you touching me?!~
@529  = ~*Shar-Teel makes a face, then with a shrug of her mighty shoulders, twitches your arm away.*~
@530  = ~I don't need you this close to be able to smell you. Take a bath, <CHARNAME>.~
@531  = ~*Shar-Teel gives you a cool look.* Too tired to travel further? Well, you're a man, after all. I shouldn't expect anything different.~
@532  = ~*She slings an arm around your waist and mockingly drags you forward a few paces.*~
@533  = ~There. Don't say I never help you. *She grins.*~
@534  = ~Man, can't you see that we would lose precious moments trying to entangle ourselves if we are attacked? Typical.~
@535  = ~*Shar-Teel's expression is nonplussed, as she looks at your frantically wriggling fingers.*~
@536  = ~*She probably can't feel it through the armor.*~
@537  = ~*Shar-Teel's furious expression is only marred by a snort of laughter, which escapes through her nose. Her face flames, and she pushes you away roughly.*~
@538  = ~*Shar-Teel remains perfectly still, watching your efforts with a detached curiosity. Only her stiff shoulders tell you that her immobility is a matter of self control* ~
@539  = ~*She is showing you how tough she is.*~
@540  = ~I've heard, in Calimshan they drench prisoners in syrup and place then naked on the fire ants' anthill. You are now putting me in a mind to try this one on you.~
@541  = ~*Shar-Teel looks at you quizzically, then shoves you right back. If you are not mistaken, that would be a grin on her lips.*~
@542  = ~*Shar-Teel begins to speak, then suddenly starts and points at something behind you. You turn to look, and feel a comradely blow hit you between your shoulder blades. When you turn back, Shar-Teel is swaggering off in another direction, and from her expression, you suspect that chocolate would not melt in her mouth.*~
@543  = ~*Shar-Teel shoves you back, which prompts more shoving from you. This quickly degenerates into general horseplay and friendly manhandling, accompanied by a few Shar-Teel grunts of amusement.*~
@544  = ~*She abruptly stops the revelry, adjusts her armor and glares at you, though without her usual malice.* Let's stop with the idiocy, <CHARNAME>.~
@545  = ~*Shar-Teel narrows her eyes at you.* Not now, <CHARNAME>.~
@546  = ~*Shar-Teel tears off the steel elements of her armor, pulls on a pair of thigh high leather boots, then whips you with the rose.*~
@547  = ~*Or at least you wish she would.*~
@548  = ~*Shar-Teel's expression is one of poorly masked confusion. She takes the rose, straightens her shoulders, then slowly and deliberately uses the petals to wipe her sword.*~
@549  = ~*As the rose is gradually cut to pieces along the blade, her expression turns to disgust.*~
@550  = ~Useless! *The rest of the rose is thrown away.*~
@551  = ~*Shar-Teel flings the rose back in your face. The sweet scent does nothing to ease the pain of the thorns buried in your cheek. As your eyes fill with reflexive tears, you note that at least you raised a smile on her face.*~
@552  = ~*Shar-Teel crushes the rose with her fist, wincing as the sharp thorns pierce her flesh. She drops the crumpled mess of petals to the ground, then grabs your hand and squeezes it firmly. You feel the base of the thorns pricking into your palm as you stare into her eyes for a long moment. Her grip grows tighter and the thorns scrape uncomfortably.*~
@553  = ~*Let go with a whimper.* ~
@554  = ~*Continue to hold her hand.* ~
@555  = ~*You continue to gaze into her eyes for a long, silent moment.*~
@556  = ~*When she lets go, your palm is crisscrossed with a smattering of thorns and her blood. She presses her hand against your cheek gruffly before turning away. From the expression that was on her face, you appear to have passed some sort of test.*~
@557  = ~*She smirks and drops your hand, then wipes her palm across her hip carelessly.*~
@558  = ~The only good blade is a sword. *Shar-Teel tosses the dagger over her shoulder.*~
@559  = ~I said I don't want this, <CHARNAME>, or are you too stupid to understand a simple statement?~
@560  = ~The next time I see this, it's going into your stomach, <CHARNAME>.~
@561  = ~*She grasps the dagger and thrusts it toward your stomach.*~
@562  = ~*Step out of the way.*~
@563  = ~*Stand your ground.*~
@564  = ~*The blade misses you by a fraction of an inch. Shar-Teel straightens up and regards you with something that, from anybody else, might have been called respect.* Few men could have avoided that blow. You're learning, <CHARNAME>.~
@565  = ~*You notice that she pockets the dagger as she turns away.*~
@566  = ~*Despite your sidestep, the blade is driven a fraction of an inch into your stomach before the thrust stops. Shar-Teel straightens up and regards the flesh wound with disdain.* You brought this on yourself, <CHARNAME>.~
@567  = ~*She drops the dagger to the ground and places a boot on the blade. Making sure your attention is on her, she reached down, grasps the handle and wrenches upwards. The dagger's blade is bent, the entire weapon rendered useless. After holding your eyes for a moment, she turns and walks away.*~
@568  = ~*The blade drives into your stomach easily enough, yet does not travel more than a fraction of an inch before Shar-Teel pulls it back. She looks at you in confusion.*~
@569  = ~Brave, <CHARNAME>, but stupid. I said you were over-brawny before, and you've proved me correct. Learn when your life is threatened, and you might live longer.~
@570  = ~It will be my pleasure to make you bleed.~
@571  = ~As long as you don't cry *too* hard when I cut you, <CHARNAME>.~
@572  = ~*snorts* For sport? I prefer more challenging opponents than you, <CHARNAME>.~
@573  = ~If you want to bed someone who changes opinions - try Drizzt.~
@574  = ~You? *doubles over with laughter* You... you are lucky I am in a good mood, or you'd be collecting your teeth from the ground.~
@575  = ~Convictions are not negotiable, dumb ass.~
@576  = ~Yeah, of course. Before I thought that men were pathetic, useless and spineless worms. Now I add *blabber mouthed* to it!~
@577  = ~*Examines you critically, her eyes sharp as two daggers.* Let's see. Pathetic - check, thinks with the hair on his chest - check, meows as a new born kitten - check, will hopefully die before he procreates  check. No, I think my opinion on males stands.~
@578  = ~Didn't your Gorion teach you to keep your mouth shut? *It sounds like she had said it automatically.*~
@579  = ~*She thinks awhile, and when you lose hope of her ever replying, she speaks.* No, no... you did not. But keep trying, it's fun to watch.~
@580  = ~What bloody difference does it make? I'm wed to my sword.~
@581  = ~I'm taking pride in how well I've trained you. If I am placed in charge of the whole mankind, maybe then there is hope for your weaker sex.~
@582  = ~*grudgingly* You are the better man than any I've met; but it only shows how ugly the rest of men are.~
@583  = ~*amusedly* I came to think of you in terms of 'lousy, but mine'. I don't waste my time on pondering about others.~
@584  = ~That you have to ask me this question to prove something to yourself is your answer.~
@585  = ~If I were in the mood I would have said 'yes', just to see you dance with joy. Men are so gullible, insecure and plain paaa-the-tic!~
@586  = ~*Shar-Teel immediately stomps on your foot with her heel.*~
@587  = ~*Despite the pain, you keep kissing her.*~
@588  = ~*With a croak, you let go of her.*~
@589  = ~Is that all you got, wench?~
@590  = ~*Shar-Teel shoves you roughly away and demonstratively wipes her lips dry.*~
@591  = ~*Shar-Teel's knee strikes into your groin.*~
@592  = ~I'll give you this one for your perseverance... *Shar-Teel's lips part, responding to your kiss.*~
@593  = ~You got a nervous tick or something, lover-boy?~
@594  = ~*Shar-Teel shrugs her shoulders.*~
@595  = ~*Shar-Teel crosses her arms over her chest and stares at you unblinking, until you blush and turn away. You hear her laughing behind your back.*~
@596  = ~*Shar-Teel scowls in response.*~
@597  = ~*Shar-Teel's elbow connects hard on your ribs.*~
@598  = ~*Shar-Teel wriggles away with a disgusted grunt.*~
@599  = ~*Shar-Teel snarls at you.* Pushing your luck again, lover-boy?~
@600  = ~*Shar-Teel's presses herself against you briefly, but then pushes you away with both hands.*~
@601  = ~Hey! I am no whore for you to sweet talk! That was my mother's thing. I want nothing of it, and I will not humiliate myself by talking to some male. That's what Ysena taught me - men are the weaker sex, not women. If you do not know Ysena, it's not my fault that you are a fool. She was the greatest mercenary that has ever lived. I ran into Ysena when I went to buy food for my oh so powerful brothers. *laughs* A few months under her - and I could beat both of them up... and my father... I think I can take him on now. After him saying that a girl is born for handling ladles, not swords! HA! Bugger him!~
@602  = ~What? What do you want to know? I am Ysena's pupil. If you do not know Ysena, it's not my fault that you are a fool. She was the greatest mercenary that lived. I ran into Ysena when I went to buy food for my oh so powerful brothers. *laughs* A few months under her - and I could beat both of them up... and my father... I think I can take him on now. After him saying that a girl is born for handling ladles, not swords! HA! Bugger him! I am not going to be a whore like my mother! I want to fight. Now step out of my way!~
@603  = ~I love bloodshed, and if you weren't flapping your tongue at me, I'd get some!~
@604  = ~Why are you stuffing me with words? Do I look like a goose to you? Get back to the road, and maybe we will get to fight someone yet. My blood is high for killing.~
@605  = ~Bugger off! Or do you want me to roll your entrails on my sword and knit a sweater out of it, like a good little lady should? ~
@606  = ~You are pissing me off with your stupid questions. Just shoot, shovel and shut up... I'll do the rest. Takes a woman's courage to fight upfront.~
@607  = ~*Shar-Teel joins in, pitching up her voice in a mocking imitation of a sensual performance.*~
@608  = ~*Your horrific duet continues until the wolves join in.*~
@609  = ~*Your horrific duet continues until the dogs join in.*~
@610  = ~*Shar-Teel snorts.* It's nice to be appreciated by the crowd.~
@611  = ~*At least she stopped singing.*~
@612  = ~*coldly* Was I mad to expect someone like you to appreciate art.~
@613  = ~*coldly* Was I mad to expect someone like you to appreciate art?~
@614  = ~*You laugh and adjust your voice accordingly.*~
@615  = ~Come, she-bear, I want to hear your singing voice. Give it a try.~
@616  = ~Come, she-bear, I want to hear your singing voice. Give it a try.~
@617  = ~The effect is so comic that you cannot help but laugh.* ~
@618  = ~*laugh and point at Shar-Teel* What a dolt!~
@619  = ~*Safana is grooming herself yet again. She seems to be born into the role of a mercenary lady who can twist the greatest hero around her little finger... and make away with the treasure, while he is still fighting the dragon with her favour on his sleeve. Her past fascinates you, so it may well be time for a heart to heart talk with Safana.*~ [X#BLANK]

@634  = ~[SAFANA 5] I really think this party needs new leadership.~ [%tutu_var%SAFAN05]

@668  = ~When asked about her past, SAFANA spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. The consistent details seem to be that she grew up in the city of Calimport, surrounded by luxury. Her father was a very influential noble, and though she could have had anything, she apparently found herself too confined by her father's protective arm. She ran away in her early teens with the help of the first mate of the pirate ship 'Exzesus,' and remained with the crew for several years as they raided up and down the Sword Coast. Eventually she tried to manipulate the captain and found herself in a lot of trouble, escaping when the ship was at port in Baldur's Gate. She has many stories of her escapades after that, but if there is a grain of truth in them you certainly cannot find it.~ [DUMMYSND]

@695  = ~Ah, much better, now I can tell everything about myself. I was born in Calimport to a man who was a great politician, but a lousy father. My mother was a siren... is not it obvious from my appearance? I would not stand for being his little girl forever, so I ran away to adventure on the pirate ship "Exzesus"... To see the world... and men, of course. Big, strong men... Alas, some of them are such gutless slime... not you, of course. Like that Captain! Put me on shore for one tiny favour I asked... But it's all turned out for the best, with me borrowing Black Alaric's map and meeting you.~

The young prince, whose name I cannot divulge - he is considered dead by his enemies, you understand? - was still on it. In disguise, of course. But he opened himself to me, due to my exquisite manners, no doubt... ~
@700  = ~I begged the Captain for the young man's life and helped him to escape under the cover of darkness. He kissed me before disappearing forever in the mist so hotly that my lips still burn at the memory. Wild bloods are those Tethyrians. I hope that those awful rebels did not catch and hang him. It would have been a shame to kill someone so beautiful.~
@701  = ~"Exzesus" once took a beating... I do not remember exactly what it was... a magic fire in the hull, perhaps... but the fact remains that we had to enter an estuary of a nameless river in Amn for repairs. The Amnish fleet sniffed us out, though, and was coming for us. While everyone panicked, I dressed in my best gown and went to find the lieutenant who led the search parties. Ah, he was a beautiful man! Wide shouldered, with a moustache like sable, and those hot black Amnish eyes! While my crew sweated on repairs, I convinced the lieutenant that his troops are far better employed in protecting pasha's caravan and his innocent daughter than searching for a pirate ship. I have never had a merrier time in my whole life! It is amusing, but men are willing to do anything for the maidenhead of pasha's daughter... He was amazed at how much a virgin can know of the ways of love afterwards... Of course, not finding the caravan in the assigned location three days inland might have upset the poor man.~

@752 = ~Als Ihr ALORA nach ihrer Vergangenheit fragt, erfahrt Ihr, dass sie ursprünglich aus Iriaebor kommt. Sie war ein niedliches, offenherziges Kind, dessen Neugierde ihm oft zum Verhängnis wurde und seinen Eltern schlaflose Nächte bereitete. Sie versuchten, ihre Tollkühnheit zu zügeln und sie davon zu überzeugen, sich wie andere Halblinge mit Heim und Herd zufriedenzugeben. Für Alora war diese Enge jedoch unerträglich. Also machte sie sich auf den Weg, die Welt zu erkunden. Schon bald stellte sie fest, dass sie Schwierigkeiten wie ein Magnet anzog und immer wieder an die falschen Orte und die falschen Leute geriet. Schließlich landete sie in Baldurs Tor, wo sie ihren zukünftigen Beruf fand: die Diebeskunst. Ihr lag noch nie viel an Reichtümern, doch meint sie, dass zu viele interessante Dinge hinter verschlossenen Türen verborgen sind. Mit ihrer bescheidenen Art schafft sie es immer wieder, die Behörden an der Nase herumzuführen. Ihr unwiderstehlicher Charme hat sie auch schon oft vor der Gefängniszelle bewahrt.~ [DUMMYSND]

She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troupe in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry however, and on their first raid she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly.

@910  = ~I look at you, and I think of snow, Branwen.~
@911  = ~Branwen, your eyes...~
@912  = ~*Branwen gazes at you, her expression stony, and your hand involuntary stretches towards her face, to chase this look away.*~
@913  = ~*You bend to the nearest fountain and playfully splash Branwen with cold water.*~
@914  = ~*You bend to the small stream nearby and playfully splash Branwen with cold water.*~
@915  = ~Care to join me in my bedroll tonight?~
@916  = ~Branwen, love, stop flirting with me!~
@917  = ~'Tis nothing, Branwen.~
@918  = ~Branwen, I think that we made a grave mistake. We should stay comrades in arms.~
@919  = ~Do... do you mean it seriously? *sigh* Yes, <CHARNAME>. Of course. ~
@920  = ~No, <CHARNAME>.~
@921  = ~*Branwen grins at you.* You will join me in mine!~
@922  = ~'Tis not the most seductive offer I've ever heard, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap you need sharpening your skills in eloquence and fluency, hmm?~
@923  = ~*Branwen wraps around you, her hips practically melting with yours, and briefly touches your lips with a tip of her tongue, before withdrawing sharply.* Why not, <CHARNAME>?~
@924  = ~Yes, my strong warrior. 'Twill be as soon as you give a call to settle, and I confess, I await the command eagerly.~
@925  = ~What do you think, <CHARNAME>? Could I pass such a lucrative chance?~
@926  = ~I will gladly purge my troubles and sorrows in your embrace. *Branwen kisses you softly.*~
@927  = ~Of course... *She sends you a long, promising look.*~
@928  = ~'Tis high time you remembered that. My sheets grow cold without your rearing fires.~
@929  = ~*Branwen gives an involuntary squeal as the first drops hit her neck, and pounces on you like an angry cat. However, it only leads to the rest of the water landing square in her face, cooling her down. She blinks and opens her mouth slightly, looking suddenly small and girlish, wet strands clinging to her brow and cheeks in a humble and diminishing manner.* ~
@930  = ~I'm sorry, Branwen. It was only a joke.~
@931  = ~Ha, look at yourself! A wet hen, you are! ~
@932  = ~*She is still beautiful... You kiss Branwen.* ~
@933  = ~Hmph! *Branwen gives you a sour look and stalks away.*~
@934  = ~*Branwen looks at you for several seconds, bewilderment in her face slowly giving place to disgust. Then she wipes her face with a sleeve and turns away without sparing you a second glance. Probably, this time you went too far*~
@935  = ~*Her lips are cold and wet, but you feel the heat coming from within. Warmer, warmer... when you part, her face is almost dry. She smirks and gives you a light peck on the cheek.* I'll forgive you this time, <CHARNAME>.~
@936  = ~*Branwen ducks, and next moment a generous dose of icy cold water splashes you from head to foot.* 'Tis dangerous to play unfair with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@937  = ~*Without further notice, Branwen pushes you head-first to the water, and dives next. Your chest gets caught in an iron hoop, as cold, transparent water embraces you, and you choke, unable to breathe, as your knees scrape the slippery bottom, and your hands are gripping air.*~
@938  = ~*Next moment, you feel a hand on your shoulder, firmly pulling you back. You emerge back into the world of stars and wind and sunshine, only to find Branwen grinning sheepishly at you.*~
@939  = ~Well? What did you do it for?~
@940  = ~Just what I needed: a cold bath! Thank you for nearly drowning me, Branwen.~
@941  = ~My sweet savior...~
@942  = ~That was a fitting revenge, I admit.~
@943  = ~Bah! Tit for tat, <CHARNAME>. *mutters* No sense of fine humor at all... ~
@944  = ~*Branwen kisses you, momentarily pushing you underwater again. Her body makes the water warmer and more welcome, and her mouth bestows most pleasant sensations on yours, as her hands explore your body. However, it's over all too soon, as she gives you a final kiss and lends you a hand, helping you out.*~
@945  = ~*She rolls her eyes.* <CHARNAME>, you are such a boy. But I admit, 'tis not unbecoming.~
@946  = ~*Branwen jumps to the side deftly, and playfully wriggles a finger at you.*~
@947  = ~*Her clothes cling to the skin in a most alluring manner, so she looks practically naked below the waist. As you look at Branwen, your own body seems to catch fire.* ~
@948  = ~*She licks a drop of water off her face, seemingly enjoying the pleasant coolness it gives.* Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I needed that.~
@949  = ~*frowns* Such light-hearted demeanor is unfitting for a man grown. I advise you to rein it in, before it slips beyond your control.~
@950  = ~*You cup her jaw in your palm, and she smiles mischievously. With a sly wink, Branwen reaches for your own face, and brings it closer to hers, finishing the movement with a very satisfactory kiss.*~
@951  = ~*Her skin is tanned and weatherworn, but still pleasant to the touch. Enjoying your intimacy, Branwen raises her head slightly, allowing you to caress her throat, and snaps at your palm playfully, when you are finally about to withdraw it.* ~
@952  = ~*For several minutes, your fingers keep tracing her straight, regular features, as your lover watches you from under her eyelashes. When you step back, a perfectly relaxed smile plays on Branwen's lips.*~
@953  = ~*Branwen snorts and steps back. Obviously, she is not in the mood for frivolities.* ~
@954  = ~*She frowns, and you have no choice but to chase her stony look away with a kiss. It works.*~
@955  = ~*She remains stock still, but a sparkle in your eyes clearly tells you that you have achieved the desired result.*~
@956  = ~*Branwen rests her cheek upon your hand and closes her eyes for a moment, smiling to herself. Her features are now soft, calm and very feminine - you rarely see her like this.*~
@957  = ~There is no need, <CHARNAME>. I am fine.~
@958  = ~*closes her eyes* What color are they?~
@959  = ~Green.~
@960  = ~Grey.~
@961  = ~Blue.~
@962  = ~Brown.~
@963  = ~Black.~
@964  = ~*She opens her eyes and smiles.* Good try.~
@965  = ~*Her eyes are deep blue.*~
@966  = ~*She opens her eyes.* You like them indeed, then.~
@967  = ~Wrong answer! *She makes a few steps with her eyes closed, before she finally gives up teasing you. Her eyes are blue.*~
@968  = ~*She kisses you quickly on the tip of your nose.* Very good.~
@969  = ~*Without replying, she opens her eyes - they are the color of the summer sky.*~
@970  = ~'Tis said among my people that when a man compliments a woman's eyes, his own rest lower.~
@971  = ~I have eyes, indeed. So do you.~
@972  = ~*blush* Erm... yes. Yes.~
@973  = ~Yes, I have eyes... I have eyes only for you.~
@974  = ~They are very blue, Branwen, your eyes.~
@975  = ~*She laughs and musses up your hair.* You're sweet.~
@976  = ~And I thought I could forgive you anything. But not this pun! *laughs*~
@977  = ~Indeed, they are. 'Tis particular in my family.~
@978  = ~My eyes? What of them?~
@979  = ~They are that of a human, but they are as shiny as the polished gems of the dwarves...~
@980  = ~I like them very much.~
@981  = ~N-nothing.~
@982  = ~*Branwen looks at you in surprise.*~
@983  = ~They are as bright as the cherished stars of the elves...~
@984  = ~Uhm... I like them very much.~
@985  = ~*cough* They are very blue, Branwen, your eyes.~
@986  = ~Why, thank you. If I could, I would lend them to you.~
@987  = ~'Tis quite an observant notion. Would that you be just as sharp in battle.~
@988  = ~My eyes are gems and... nothing?~
@989  = ~*swallow* I...~
@990  = ~My eyes are gems and stars and... nothing?~
@991  = ~They are as colorful as the summer flowers of the halflings...~
@992  = ~Really?~
@993  = ~And I... uhm... I like them very much.~
@994  = ~Really... No... It's... it's n-nothing.~
@995  = ~Have you ran out of sentient races, <CHARNAME>?~
@996  = ~Yep.~
@997  = ~No, but I will tell you more next time. If you are gentle...~
@998  = ~I will have to be gentle, then... very gentle. *She gives you a shove on your back, propelling you forward.*~
@999  = ~Like this? *She kisses you ever so slightly on your cheek.*~
@1000 = ~Do I even want to know what 'tis of the orcs that my eyes possess?~
@1001 = ~No, lady, it is just your character that has semblance to the orcish things.~
@1002 = ~Perhaps you'd like to hear a gnomish theme, instead?~
@1003 = ~Nope.~
@1004 = ~*Branwen laughs.* I doubt that my faith allows me to kiss you for that, <CHARNAME>. Why, your tongue is a bladed weapon, and sharp, I think.~
@1005 = ~Gnomish 'tis, then.~
@1006 = ~Your eyes, Branwen, are as intricate as the complex artifacts of the gnomes.~
@1007 = ~Orcish, <CHARNAME>... if you are able.~
@1008 = ~Your eyes, Branwen, are as unyielding as mailed fists of the orcs.~
@1009 = ~*She kisses you almost shyly* I... thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1010 = ~*she laughs* Despite the silliness, there is hidden wisdom in your words. 'Tis that every creature, blessed with soul by the gods, have something admirable about them, if you look closely enough.~
@1011 = ~You are still such a boy.~
@1012 = ~The men of Norheim compare their lovers to fire, <CHARNAME>. ~
@1013 = ~That, too. Now that I think of it, you remind me of hot winds of the South, of thunderstorms and sunshine.~
@1014 = ~But I am not a man of Norheim.~
@1015 = ~And I agree with their assessment! They know better than I.~
@1016 = ~Why is that, <CHARNAME>?~
@1017 = ~I look at you, and I imagine you standing in a cloak of white, lined with shiny furs as the snowflakes slip by you, a moving veil around your face.~
@1018 = ~You are fair, Branwen. So fair...~
@1019 = ~Because I like seeing the healthy blush that snow brings to your cheeks. They are so cold and fresh when I kiss them, so frosty that I have to warm my lips on yours. And your lips are like fire burning in the snows.~
@1020 = ~Why do I remind you of the hot winds?~
@1021 = ~Because when you are present, my mouth goes dry.~
@1022 = ~Because you are hot!~
@1023 = ~How should I know? It's just a feeling.~
@1024 = ~Because you remind me of all things and none, my lovely Branwen.~
@1025 = ~Thunderstorms? Not that old joke again! Tempestuous priestess, bah. What of the other things?~
@1026 = ~Why do I remind you of sunshine?~
@1027 = ~Because you warm me with your presence.~
@1028 = ~Why do I remind you of snow?~
@1029 = ~*She ruffles your hair.* I'll teach you my people's ways, yet.~
@1030 = ~*Branwen looks at you thoughtfully, her eyes slightly glazed, apparently enthralled with your daydream.*~
@1031 = ~Every color of yours - the gold of your hair, the azure depth of your eyes, the pink of your cheeks and the red of your lips - is brighter in the presence of white, and it shines so clearly, so seductively that I can do nothing but to kiss you and let the snowflakes thaw between our lips.~
@1032 = ~*cough* I speak like a pompous idiot. Let us go.~
@1033 = ~*Branwen laughs* When it snows at Norheims, 'tis sticky, wet slush. I much prefer strong summer rains.~
@1034 = ~*Branwen turns to the light, so you can see the full truth of your words: her glowing skin and lustrous hair, rolling over her shoulders in slow motion.*~
@1035 = ~O, Branwen the Fair, Branwen of the Snow...~
@1036 = ~*You watch her with delight.*~
@1037 = ~*You nod stiffly: she is beautiful. So what?*~
@1038 = ~Are you sure that you recall correctly? *She kisses you, and her lips are as much of a flame as you remember.*~
@1039 = ~The men of my land had long learned how to correct it. *She touches the drinking horn, slung from her belt.* Drink for my health and wellbeing tonight, <CHARNAME> and for our victory!~
@1040 = ~'Tis you who is feverish, <CHARNAME>, not I. *Branwen presses her cheek against yours. It is pleasantly cool.*~
@1041 = ~*chuckles* You say strange things sometimes.~
@1042 = ~Spare me your riddles!~
@1043 = ~*Before the last word is said, Branwen's lips find yours. This kiss would melt an iceberg in the Sea of Moving Ice, let alone a snowflake.*~
@1044 = ~So, you like what you see. *Her voice is level, but a glad spark can be spotted lurking on the bottom of her eyes, if one knows where to look.*~
@1045 = ~*As the party silently walks down the beaten path, Branwen pounces on your back.* ~
@1046 = ~*You stumble forward with a surprised yell, alerting the other party members, who at first think that you were attacked by some vicious animal. When they notice it is only Branwen, all they do is roll their eyes.*~
@1047 = ~*You manage to support the combined weight of Branwen, along with both her and your own equipment. Branwen laughs as you hoist her further up your back, but you decide to turn the tables against her by reaching behind and grabbing her waist, and with a mighty swing, she is soon facing you and hanging off of your hips. You mash a long and deep kiss upon her lips, both out of pure desire and to stifle the incessant laughing she emits. After your reluctant parting, she slips down from your arms and hugs you tightly, before resuming pace with the rest of the party.*~
@1048 = ~*You bend easily, allowing her to slip off your back and to the ground. As she lies there cursing, you graciously offer her your arm, and she starts to snicker instead.* 'Tis true, <CHARNAME>. You can.~
@1049 = ~*You turn around sharply, managing to catch Branwen before she falls. She answers you with a fierce kiss, and soon, you engage in another match of sorts...* ~
@1050 = ~*You lurch forward with a forlorn yelp, resigned to the fact that the hard ground is quite suddenly rushing up to meet you. Both you and Branwen hit the dirt with a resounding smack, but Branwen at least has a most convenient cushion for her fall. Branwen breathes into your ear and whispers a half-hearted apology before kissing your temple. The pain from the fall vanishes from your mind, as you roll under Branwen and stare up into her smiling, beautiful features.*~
@1051 = ~Do you forgive me, <CHARNAME>? *Branwen wears her most innocent look, and trails a finger down your forehead and the length of your nose, stopping at your lips. She then leans down and kisses you very sweetly on the lips, causing your heart to beat fiercely and your stomach to tie in knots.*~
@1052 = ~I knew you would! *She lets you up then, allowing you to gather your equipment and the last bit of your dignity before hugging you tightly, and resuming her place in line.*~
@1053 = ~*Her weight, together with your already heavy backpack, causes you to stumble and fall on the spot. Branwen manages to stay on her feet, and, laughing, she helps you up.* 'Twas unwise to compete with me, <CHARNAME>. But mayhap you will claim victory in another contest. Tonight will be the proper time.~
@1054 = ~*You are not able to support both of you, and you fall flat on the ground, face down. Your mouth is soon full of dust and dirt, and from the sharp pain between your eyes, you seem to have broken your nose.*~
@1055 = ~*Branwen leans over you, looking concerned.* I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Here, let me help.~
@1056 = ~*She quickly chants a spell, and the pain subsides. She smirks proudly as you struggle to your feet.* 'Twill take you months of exercise to beat me, still.~
@1057 = ~Because you are wounded! Drink a potion, lest I have to heal you forcefully, and by Tempus, I will!~
@1058 = ~*Branwen smiles mysteriously and winks at you. She begins to quietly hum a random tune and turns away, pretending to occupy herself with cleaning her weapons, while still watching you from the corner of her eye.*~
@1059 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have been a good friend to me.~
@1060 = ~*Branwen smiles and clasps hands with yours. She gazes into your eyes with a look that mixes between wonder and affection, and runs her free hand down your cheek and jaw line, sending a slight shiver to course down your spine.* ~
@1061 = ~*Branwen places her hands on your hips and kisses you, slowly and deliberately, her teasing tongue wandering and exploring, her full, soft lips locked with yours. She grins as she breaks the embrace.* I have been waiting for a proper moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@1062 = ~Because 'tis a pleasure to watch you.~
@1063 = ~*winks* Because you were watching me, <CHARNAME>. 'Twas a simple courtesy to answer you with the like.~
@1064 = ~*laughs* Don't you know?~
@1065 = ~*Branwen turns her bright gaze upward into your eyes and, leaning into you, gives you an impassioned kiss to your lips.*~
@1066 = ~*Branwen bestows to you a quick kiss to your cheek, smiling gently as she does so. You hope for more, but instead she turns her back to you, allowing you a splendid view of her graceful yet strong figure.*~
@1067 = ~*Branwen turns and bites at the tip of your nose playfully. Before you can ask what brought that on, she has already moved behind you, and wraps her arms around your neck, breathing contently.* ~
@1068 = ~*She shakes her hair, so that tiny flecks of gold seem to fly in all direction. A stray strand lashes at your mouth, and you kiss it, so perfect and soft.*~
@1069 = ~*Branwen grins teasingly and whips her mane out of sight.*~
@1070 = ~*Her hair is so pale that it seems to emanate a light of its own. You kiss her cascading tresses, and feel Branwen reclining against your chest.*~
@1071 = ~'Tis the best compliment to my hair, <CHARNAME>.~
@1072 = ~*For some odd reasons, her hair smells of milk and honey, making you breathe more deeply and fully, reveling in its scent.* ~
@1073 = ~*Branwen quickly inspects your shoulder and the straps of your travelling gear and pack. She notices that a strap is loose on your arm, and tightens it for you.* You must remember to keep your travelling equipment in proper order, though I do not mind lending a hand every now and then.~
@1074 = ~*Branwen's concern turns to smile after she inspects your shoulder.* Liar, my sweet liar.~
@1075 = ~*She runs her hand down the length of your arm in a gentle caress.* That should do it. ~
@1076 = ~You should have told me earlier! *You take pleasure in both pain receding and Branwen's closeness, as she heals your wound*~
@1077 = ~*Branwen frowns* I suggest that you command us to stop soon. You need time to heal and rest. *There is more gentleness in her voice than a healer would have for her patient.*~
@1078 = ~Tsk, tsk. Listen to reason, for once! Next time seek help *before* your wounds start festering.~
@1079 = ~This wound is beyond my skill. <CHARNAME>, we should hasten to the temple!~
@1080 = ~'Tis not just your shoulder, 'tis your whole body that is bleeding! Lie still, reckless boy!~
@1081 = ~Yes, 'tis a grave injury. Now, where are these healing potions of yours? 'Tis no use to hoard them, if you are dead.~
@1082 = ~You cannot go on like this! I say we stop, <CHARNAME>. Now. ~
@1083 = ~*Branwen moves closer to you and gently eases her body against yours for support.*~
@1084 = ~*Branwen pulls your body to hers and holds you close. She fits perfectly against you, as though your bodies have grown to come together in harmony, like two pieces of a puzzle. As soon as you come into contact with each other, her breathing eases into a steady, content rhythm. It warms your heart to know you can soothe her in such a way.*~
@1085 = ~*You can't help but feel emptier when she is out of your arms.* ~
@1086 = ~*Branwen sighs and slips her hands over your shoulders, entangling her fingers in your hair. Her firm, steady strokes send shivers down to the very tips of your fingers, causing you to hold her tighter.* ~
@1087 = ~*Branwen moves your hand aside and unfastens her cloak, pressing into your torso. Her large, soft breasts press into your chest, her tongue touches your chin... but you reach out your hand, and she is gone.*~
@1088 = ~*You come up to Branwen and adjust her cloak around her shoulders, and her hood around her neck. You cannot resist the urge to seize this opportunity, and hold her in your arms for a moment longer than strictly necessary.* ~
@1089 = ~*She gives you a knowing smile.* 'Tis hard to resist sometimes, I know.~
@1090 = ~*Branwen traces your hand up from the clasp of her cloak, along her jaw line and cheek.* Despite the robustness of the road, your hands are still gentle. I like that.~
@1091 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis a pity, but we should move on.~
@1092 = ~*You turn your attention to Branwen, and the Norheim priestess smiles at you warmly.* Yes, <CHARNAME>?~ [X#BLANK]
@1093 = ~*Bring Branwen's hand to your heart*~
@1094 = ~*Kiss Branwen on the cheek*~
@1095 = ~*Put a hand around Branwen's waist*~
@1096 = ~*Ruffle Branwen's hair*~
@1097 = ~*Stare at Branwen*~
@1098 = ~What are you thinking of, Branwen?~
@1099 = ~Thank you for joining my group. You are a great help and inspiration in battle.~
@1100 = ~You are beautiful, Branwen.~
@1101 = ~Branwen, I've got something very sweet for you... ~
@1102 = ~*Play with Branwen's greenstone necklace*~
@1103 = ~Branwen, I am sorry, but I think we should stay friends.~
@1104 = ~Branwen, please, stop flirting with me.~
@1105 = ~Truly? Very well, <CHARNAME>, I will abide by your wish.~
@1106 = ~'Tis a sea-charm, <CHARNAME>. See how smooth it is? The waves polished it and drilled a hole in it. I nigh can see the Seawolf bay when I look at it long enough.*~
@1107 = ~*Branwen smiles while your fingers play with the stone*~
@1108 = ~Your skin is smoother than the polished stone. And warmer...~
@1109 = ~*Encouraged by her smile, you let your fingers wander, sliding ever so gently to the beckoning cove below the necklace.*~
@1110 = ~*withdraw your hand*~
@1111 = ~From the blush on your face, you need to be chilled, <CHARNAME>. Would that I be a druid and could conjure an icy blizzard to ease your fever.~
@1112 = ~It is strange, I feel that the stone is very warm now against my skin.~
@1113 = ~*Branwen raises her eyebrow.* I though you did lack neither in agility to misplace your hands so badly, nor in common sense if that is intentional. *She slaps your hand away.*~
@1114 = ~*Branwen's eyes widen, and she is speechless for a moment. Then she deliberately moves away.*~
@1115 = ~*chuckles* My nephew liked playing just like that, when he was a babe at arms.~
@1116 = ~*Branwen makes a subtle movement with her shoulders, and the stone rolls from one gentle slope to another and then falls back into the cove between her breasts.*~
@1117 = ~*Branwen cranes her neck to better see what you are doing. She grins.*~
@1118 = ~Am I to assume that you are thinking right now that this stone can be fitted into a sling, should we run out of stones?~
@1119 = ~*She takes the pendant from your hand, her fingers caressing yours for a short moment. Her touch is electrifying.*~
@1120 = ~*She scowls.* In this stone I keep the souls of the ensorcelled men, who fell under my spell. Do you hear them wailing for my love and mercy?~
@1121 = ~*laughs* Oh, the look on your face! 'Tis precious!~
@1122 = ~Hmm? What is it?~
@1123 = ~A rare find, Branwen. It's a morsel of dried fruit from Evereska.~
@1124 = ~It's a peach, Branwen. As sweet and rosy as your cheeks, I might add.~
@1125 = ~A small bite of... chocolate?~
@1126 = ~It's a mixture of nuts and dried grape juice... made by dwarves, I hear.~
@1127 = ~Some fresh honey for my lady Branwen.~
@1128 = ~Oh, nothing. Just some sweet-baked bread I bought in the nearest tavern.~
@1129 = ~Some cherries for you. The color of your lips, if I might add.~
@1130 = ~This. *kiss Branwen*~
@1131 = ~*She tries to speak with her mouth full.* These elflings know their craft, all right.~
@1132 = ~*laughs* Flatterer!~
@1133 = ~*Branwen eagerly pries the small brown brick from your hands.* I've not seen it in years! Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1134 = ~'Tis good, <CHARNAME>. Very good. Humor me again, if you can help it.~
@1135 = ~*After finishing the jar, Branwen slowly and seductively licks her lips.*~
@1136 = ~*Branwen touches your hand gently.* Do not belittle your efforts, my friend. I am glad with this simple treat.~
@1137 = ~'Twill be so in a few moments. Cherry juice is claimed to leave stains everywhere. *Branwen pops a cherry into her mouth.*~
@1138 = ~Liar! Sweet, sweet liar... *Branwen kisses you back.*~
@1139 = ~*Branwen smiles mysteriously.* I've been told that before, <CHARNAME>.~
@1140 = ~You are quite good-looking yourself, <CHARNAME>. And 'tis not only your face I have in mind. ~
@1141 = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@1142 = ~*winks* 'Twill be a pleasure to present you with other facets of my beauty, then. In due time.~
@1143 = ~*Branwen gives you a slow smile.* 'Tis more than a compliment from a man such as yourself. Should I consider it as a... promise?~
@1144 = ~*Branwen slowly spins around, her hands on her hips.*~
@1145 = ~*gulp*~
@1146 = ~Yes, very beautiful.~
@1147 = ~*say nothing*~
@1148 = ~*Branwen steps into your arms.* I am glad you think so, <CHARNAME>.~
@1149 = ~I thank you.~
@1150 = ~But I think I am not the only one, hmm?~
@1151 = ~Don't let Shar-Teel hear that, <CHARNAME>: she'll keep snapping at you for days.~
@1152 = ~And so are you. By Tempus, I've not seen such a warrior and a leader, since I left Seawolf!~
@1153 = ~Tempus willing, I shall continue to stand by your side, my friend.~
@1154 = ~'Tis nothing, <CHARNAME>. I but follow the path of the Battleguard.~
@1155 = ~You should have met the stern and proud warriors of Norheim. My prowess fades before the best of Rauthymar.~
@1156 = ~No, 'tis I who must thank you for allowing me into your group. I shall not fail you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1157 = ~I shall fight for you with utmost might, I swear.~
@1158 = ~I am proud of your approval, my friend.~
@1159 = ~<CHARNAME>... I thank you.~
@1160 = ~'Tis no secret, <CHARNAME>. I am thinking of home. To an outsider, it would seem forlorn and foreboding, but to me, 'tis the most wondrous and welcome place: a coast ripe with deep fjords and clear bays, hearty pine and lifeless bedrock, creatures evil and dangerous, people bold, simple and friendly.~
@1161 = ~Our last battle went well, but I need to be more forthright with my hammer. Tempus lends me his might, but I am still a born warrior, and must crush as well as chant.~
@1162 = ~*Branwen's gaze cascades down your body, and she smiles teasingly.* Nothing, <CHARNAME>.~
@1163 = ~I was welcoming my release from that wretched imprisonment. 'Tis good to feel sun and wind, and walk with friends, not brigands!~
@1164 = ~I was reciting my prayers, <CHARNAME>. If you wish, I could teach you of some.~

@1167 = ~I am enjoying the taste of freedom, and, by Tempus, 'tis a fine one!~
@1168 = ~*Noticing that you stare, Branwen starts to play with laces of her armor, her fingers swift and teasing. However, she soon becomes carried away, and with a loud crash, the suit of mail falls on the ground. Branwen turns crimson, and bends to pick it up without a word. While she does, you are granted several precious moments, during which you regard all the lovely aspects of her femininity. Perhaps she has done it on purpose, after all...*~
@1169 = ~Do you like what you see, <CHARNAME>? ~
@1170 = ~Ah? Mmm... yes. Yes. Of course.~
@1171 = ~My lady Branwen, your beauty is everlasting and ever shining, akin to a wondrous star descended from the skies to grace us with her divine presence!~

@1174 = ~*laughs* I admit, I was preparing a retort, but you disarmed me with your words somewhat.~
@1175 = ~Bah!~
@1176 = ~*With a movement you barely register, Branwen adjusts her armor, so you are able to see a generous amount of her cleavage. Before you are able to react, however, her hands run down her chest again, and this time, her neck and collarbone are fully covered.*~
@1177 = ~*Branwen does not notice, and you spend several minutes regarding her tall, slim figure. Her mane of golden hair dances wildly around her face, going up and down in the same stride with the heaving of her bosom. It creates quite a spectacular sight.*~
@1178 = ~*She tilts her head expectantly.* When will you recognize that 'tis time to move on?~
@1179 = ~By Tempus, <CHARNAME>, you've been keeping your eyes on naught but me lately! Isn't it boring?~
@1180 = ~*Branwen sighs, her gaze turned to the direction of the sea. It does not take you long to realize she is thinking of her home.*~

@1187 = ~*Branwen peers into your face, adjusting her hair and looking at her reflection in your eyes.* Hmm... you have skill, <CHARNAME>. Would you be willing to become my hairdresser?~
@1188 = ~*Her hair is soft and dry, if a tad unkempt. You guide your hand along the tresses, and Branwen moves closer to you, shivering in delight.*~
@1189 = ~*Branwen gives you a sly wink and sharply thrusts her hand into your own hair. Within moments, your mane is an elaborate mess.*~
@1190 = ~Had you displayed such enthusiasm in battle, <CHARNAME>, I'd be most pleased.~
@1191 = ~*Branwen guides her own hand towards yours until they meet at the top of her head, amongst her blond strands.*~

@1193 = ~*The band that keeps her hair together slips to one side, and her head of hair appears before you in its full glory. Your breath catches at your throat as you regard her rich, fair tresses which indeed look golden in the faint light.*~
@1194 = ~*Branwen flips her hair carelessly and winks at you.* You like it, then.~
@1195 = ~I've only two arms, <CHARNAME>. The left arm holds a shield, the right a hammer. Had I the third arm, I would grace you with my embrace, but 'tis impossible, alas.~
@1196 = ~<CHARNAME>, there are foes ahead and battle afoot. Cling to your sword, instead.~
@1197 = ~*Branwen stops and leans against your shoulder, smiling slightly. One of her arms wraps around your waist, and another traces a line between your shoulder blades. You could swear that she is purring contentedly.*~
@1198 = ~*Branwen's right arm slips around your own waist, and you feel a slight electric shock as her hammer bumps against your hip. She withdraws hastily.* I am sorry, my friend.~
@1199 = ~*Her armor has heated in the sun, and your unprotected hand gets burned immediately. You have no choice but to release your hold.*~
@1200 = ~*Branwen's waist would have been more slender without her armor, but it is still slim enough for your arm to grapple. She does not step away.*~
@1201 = ~You are forward with your advances. But I confess, I like it.~
@1202 = ~*Branwen embraces you in return, her hand gently coming to rest on your hip and squeezing it slightly.*~
@1203 = ~*Branwen laughs and kisses you back.* ~
@1204 = ~*She rolls her eyes and shakes her head warningly.* Pay attention to the road, <CHARNAME>. 'Twill do us no good to dally here.~
@1205 = ~*Branwen smiles at you and reaches out to stroke your cheek.* 'Twas sweet, <CHARNAME>.~
@1206 = ~*Branwen flings her arms around your neck, apparently intent on kissing you fully on the mouth, but in the last moment her lips jerk upwards, and she smacks your nose instead.*~
@1207 = ~*Her skin is very soft, far too soft for a woman of battle. However, you still have to wipe a spot of grime off her cheek to kiss her properly.*~
@1208 = ~*Branwen's skin is cool and fresh, and smells slightly of the milk. Your lips linger on her cheek a little longer than necessary.*~
@1209 = ~*As you bend to her cheek, you catch the smell of her hair. It is faint, barely perceptible, but alluring just the same.*~
@1210 = ~*smiles* Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1211 = ~*Branwen frowns* You're wounded! Here, let me help.~
@1212 = ~*Branwen gives you a wide smile.* 'Twas eloquent, if silent.~
@1213 = ~Are you always so purposeful, <CHARNAME>? Might I remind you that we've barely met?~
@1214 = ~*Branwen strokes your chest, lightly and thoughtfully.* 'Tis a heart of a warrior, <CHARNAME>.~
@1215 = ~*Her fingers tap-dance up your chest and to the neck, checking your pulse.* You're in perfect health, <CHARNAME>.~
@1216 = ~Do you wish me to listen to your heart? Hmm, I wonder what it has to say. *Branwen smiles at you and playfully presses her ear against your chest, her hair tickling your neck and arm.*~
@1217 = ~*Branwen gives you a bewildered look.* ~
@1218 = ~*Branwen's hand, normally so steady, trembles a little.* ~
@1219 = ~I have not much to tell you. I was in the employ of an adventuring group that dared to attack unarmed merchants. I battled them bravely, but a dog named Tranzig entrapped me in stone. I shall see his head leave his body if it is the last thing I do!~
@1220 = ~By Tempus unshaven beard! Leave me be with your questioning!~
@1221 = ~Bah! Talking does not help me to prove my worth to Tempus! Let me look at that gash on your cheek, <CHARNAME>. It looks nasty.~
@1222 = ~I fought many battles in Tempus name, <CHARNAME>, drank strong meads and sang the warrior's songs. What's more is there to say?~
@1223 = ~Norheim Isles are part of what you call Moonshae Islands here. Peak and rock ridges, dark pine forests and ice-fogs - that's mine land. It births sturdy folk and proud. Unlike you, soft mainlanders, we watch the foreigners with the eyes of an albatross, for we want no trouble. ~
@1224 = ~*You find Dynaheir on her own and in a quiet mood; for once, she is not sorting her scrolls or discussing things in a low voice with one of your companions. Perhaps it would be wise to take advantage of the situation and chat with the mysterious Wychlaran.*~
@1225 = ~You look concerned, Dynaheir. What's that about?~
@1226 = ~*Ihr beschließt, dass Ihr nichts weiter fragen wollt, bevor Ihr noch Dinge über Dynaheir zu hören bekommt, die Ihr gar nicht wissen wollt.*~
@1227 = ~So, Dynaheir, könnt Ihr mir mehr über Euch erzählen?~
@1228 = ~*Ihr stellt Dynaheir eine Menge persönlicher Fragen.*~
@1229 = ~*Ihr fahrt fort, eingehende Fragen über Dynaheirs Vergangenheit zu stellen.*~
@1230 = ~*Freundlich und zuvorkommend sprecht Ihr über Dynaheirs Sorgen und Wünsche, in der Hoffnung, dass Dynaheir sich Euch öffnet.*~
@1231 = ~*Ihr seid es gewohnt, dass Leute Euch ihre innigsten Sorgen berichten... Also versucht Ihr auf Eure gewohnt charmante Art, auch Dynaheir mehr über sich zu entlocken.*~
@1232 = ~Dynaheir, could you tell me more of Rashemen?~
@1233 = ~Dynaheir, could you tell me more of Rashemen?~
@1234 = ~Dynaheir, could you tell me about the other countries of the East?~
@1235 = ~*You open your map and smooth it over your knee. Here, under your fingers, lies the Realm of Baldur's Gate.* ~
@1236 = ~Dynaheir, I do not know what have come over me... will you forgive me? I harbor deep feelings for you, and no other woman.~
@1237 = ~Dynaheir, Eure Stimme ist... komisch.~

@1274 = ~[DYNAHEIR 32] I pray thee did not kiss thy mother with that mouth.~ [%tutu_var%DYNAH32]
@1275 = ~When asked about her past DYNAHEIR has very little to say. She is apparently from the far-eastern nation of Rashemen, and has come to the West with a bodyguard known as Minsc. Minsc is on his 'dajemma,' a rite of passage, and it appears that she may be involved in something similar. Of this, she will only state that great things are foretold for the Sword Coast. She seems very sure of herself, is possessed with an old-world sensibility, and is very demanding of her companions. She has expressed concerns about the sanity of her bodyguard, though she has an obvious respect for him and will not go far from his side.~ [X#BLANK]
@1276 = ~I do not need thine affections to live, and I do not measure my worth by thy favor. Remember that, hero.~
@1277 = ~Also remember that strong passions course through thy veins. 'Tis only natural, I suppose, but learn to reign them in. Some things that they will call for thee to do will not be as easy to mend as this. And a mended thing is never half as strong as the one unbroken.~
@1278 = ~*Dynaheir leans over your shoulder to take a look at the map, as well.*~
@1279 = ~What say you?~
@1280 = ~*with a smile* I love maps, Dynaheir. There is something thrilling about them, even more so than in tales of adventure.~
@1281 = ~*with a smile* I love maps, Dynaheir. There is something thrilling about them, even more so than in adventure stories.~
@1282 = ~*with a smile* I love maps, Dynaheir. There is something thrilling about them, even more so than in the stories about adventures.~
@1283 = ~I see that thou art showing thy route on the map. Seems that thou had covered much ground in thine investigation, but there is always another ruin to explore, or a hamlet not yet visited. Let us hope that thou wouldst find thy father's murderer before long, in one of these blank places on thy map...~
@1284 = ~*She taps her finger where you have indicated the location of the bandits' encampment.* Let us hope Tranzig's word doth not prove false. This region is wild and dangerous. 'Twould risk a deadly waste, to scour them for naught.~
@1285 = ~*Dynaheir frowns at the forested area so close to Baldur's Gate itself.* The Cloakwood mine is well hidden in these woods. One wouldst never have guessed that it could lie amidst the domain of druids. 'Tis cunning of thine adversary to have found it and used it for his schemes. I wonder how he hast come upon such intelligence, such resources, in the first place?~
@1286 = ~*Dynaheir studies the city of Baldur's Gate, its quarters and streets.* A grand city, that. Tread cautiously, <CHARNAME>. The wilderness produceth fewer predators than these high and low halls, these palaces.~
@1287 = ~I share thy fascination, <CHARNAME>... *She traces the contour of the jagged shore on the map lovingly, from Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate.*~
@1288 = ~*She smiles back at you.* I could almost pretend that we wert children, butting our heads together, dreaming of experiencing faraway lands. *She grows serious.* Bookish children overwhelmed by the vastness of the world for the first time. But 'tis not so... ~
@1289 = ~No, it is not. We have seen the faraway lands, and have tasted of the adventures they hold.~
@1290 = ~I remember myself at that age... I pored over maps and swallowed bards' tales. How I tried to understand what true combat feels like, when Jondalar showed me my first forms with a wooden training sword! How I listened to strangers that came to see Gorion, and tried to puzzle out what intrigue is, and what is a plot... How I imitated it in my childish games, swearing that an Evil Overlord's trail will not grow cold, that I will forever love a truehearted soul mate...~
@1291 = ~*Thoughtfully, as if reciting a poem she once loved, but had almost forgotten*. ...and it tasted bittersweet, like the waters of the Lake of Tears - like a victory dearly bought, like the kiss of parting lovers...~
@1292 = ~Thine righteous actions now art the proof that thou hadth played the right sort of games as a child and read the right sort of books, <CHARNAME>.~
@1293 = ~'Tis my pleasure. Rashemen is the eastmost of the realms explored. Beyond art naught but steppes of grass, where dwell the nomads of the Tuigan Horde and, perhaps, other peoples.~
@1294 = ~Certainly. The people of my land, Rashemi, or as they art sometimes called, Rashemaar, art shorter and sturdier than thy folk. Among us there art sheepherders, and artisans, skilled in carving stone and scrimshaw.~
@1295 = ~Thou art curious; if mine account doth not bore thee, Rashemi's main trade goods art skins and firs, and, perhaps, the works of our craftsmen. Jhuild, that they call 'firewine' here, also is a profitable trade. 'Tis strong liquor, if thou didst not realize that yet. ~
@1296 = ~Rashemen herds of goats and rothe countless in number, and my land hath sufficient mother-load of metals. But Rashemi merchants trade for grain, lumber and cloth.~
@1297 = ~Why, mayhap 'twould interest thee to know, that we have sjorl - smoked cheese. I miss the flavor, but I had not seen anything similar in thy land.~
@1298 = ~I have heard a bard here to call Rashemen the 'Land of Berserkers'. The strength of our warriors, indeed lieth in their fearless fury.~
@1299 = ~Thou knowest, perhaps, already, about the war of conquest waged on Rashemen by its southern neighbor - Thay. Why, in the past hundred winters alone, there were no less than twenty incursions that we fought.~
@1300 = ~We stand strong against Thay's plots. The Far Land, as they call us, would remain free of the foreign power, be that Thay or Mulhorand.~
@1301 = ~Our war leaders art called Hutrongs - Iron Lords - and they rule from their palace in the city of Immilmar. Tall art the palace's steel-shod towers and strong must be the man who is chosen to this high seat.~
@1302 = ~The Iron Lord is chosen by the Hathran - or as they call us here - the witches - of Rashemen. But of my sisters I cannot tell thee much. Minsc was wrong in speaking openly of what I am, for beyond Rashemen, I would have preferred to hide my station, even if I am only an apprentice. But I cannot blame Minsc in earnest, for he is not in full possession of his faculties.~
@1303 = ~Rashemen hath a mighty army, called the Fangs of Rashemen. 'Tis light cavalry, mainly, spearmen and bowmen, both. In the Battle of the Lake of Tears, the Fangs and Hathran dealt a crushing defeat to the Tuigans, slaying a quarter of the Horde, despite being outnumbered four to one.~
@1304 = ~The town of Urling is where many of my sisters dwell. When in Rashemen, one knows a Hathran by her black robes and a grey mask.~
@1305 = ~Unknowingly, thou hadst executed one of Rashemen's laws in killing the gnolls that abducted me. For the penalty for disobeying or harming a Hathran is death. But the Hathran art benevolent: none would invoke it, unless the trespass is unforgivable.~
@1306 = ~The great Lake Ashane - also called the Lake of Tears - is a battlefield between Thay and Rashemen, as well. To quell Thay's ambitions the Hathran created magic ships - the witch-ships - that roam the lake's water at will, unleashing the poisonous fumes and monstrous beasts on the Thayvian vessels.~
@1307 = ~Among my people, 'tis honorable to be strong of body and spirit, both among men and women. This spirit demonstrates itself in the amusements of my people. Thou hast not seen Rashemen if thou hast not seen snowracing. 'Tis simply a race in the snow, but 'tis... Thou hast to see it to understand its importance.~
@1308 = ~To the North of Rashemen lieth many a ruin that the adventurous explore in search of gold - or rather, gemstones, for Rashemi love of precious stones no less than the dwarves - and glory.~
@1309 = ~The ruins I have spoken of earlier art that of the great citadels of Raumathar - a mighty empire of the ages long past. To the west, there was once a magic kingdom of Narfell. 'Tis not the same as the modern Narfell. The two mighty neighbors had devoured each other; there is a lesson to us in their downfall.~
@1310 = ~*smiles* Why, Minsc must have told thee of dajemma. 'Tis a ritual journey to adulthood for the youths of my land. 'Tis perilous, but the honors awarded to the one who had returns art great and, besides, these journeys to the distant lands help acquire the insight beyond that of a rustic cowherder and the lore.~
@1311 = ~Rashemen's harsh climate breeds fierce people. Lake Tirulag, with its frigid waters, is a common site for contests of endurance. But none was hardy enough yet to win the great treasure that is said to be at the bottom of the lake and guarded by a white dragon, almost invisible to normal sight.~
@1312 = ~As of late, there were many foreign merchants in Rashemen. They travel through the Great Dale. Few art encouraged to stay, though. We do not trust outlanders, and they art not allowed to settle anywhere, but in Mulptan and Shevel.~
@1313 = ~Even if a foreigner is allowed to stay in Rashemen, he would be watched closely. Outlandish wizards especially art not welcome to linger in Rashemen or practice their Art. 'Tis safer for them as well, for anyone suspected of being a Thayvian wizard, spy, or agent wilt be challenged - and attacked - without delay.~
@1314 = ~I told thee what thou needed to know, <CHARNAME>. I empathize with thy curiosity, but 'twould be unwise of me to reveal more.~
@1315 = ~Thay is a powerful and evil nation that lieth in the eastern reaches of the known realms, bounded by Algorond and Thesk in the west, Rashemen in the north, the Inner Sea in the south, and Sunrise Mountains and Endless Waste in the east.~
@1316 = ~Thay sprawls across the mesas known as the Plateaus of Thay. 'Tis a prosperous nation ancient customs, devious government, and magiocracy.~
@1317 = ~Thay is ruled by a conclave of mages, called the Red Wizards of Thay. They art as evil as they art paranoid, and they seek no less than to maintain the tight grip on power in their own nation while undercutting the power of other realms. The mages who are not of their cult, and, in particular, those who art involved in ruling rival nations, art viewed as threats to be eliminated. None knows the total number of the Red Wizards.~
@1318 = ~The nobility of Thay - the Tharchions and Tharchionesses - govern its provinces. But not independently of the direction of the Red Wizards. Their will is known through the chosen spokesmen: the Zulkirs.~
@1319 = ~Zulkirs of Thay art the most powerful of their magical brotherhood. 'Tis believed that there art eight Zulkirs presently in Thay. The one name only is well-known beyond Thay: Zulkir Szass Tarn.~
@1320 = ~The Red Wizards' thirst to conquer is both fueled and hampered by internal strife among various factions in their midst. On one hand, they art suspicious of the mercenaries and heroes that art not of themselves, and thus diminish their forces. But, on another hand, the most ambitious faction leaders see the conquest of foreign lands as a way to expand the dominion at home by bringing home victories from the battlefields.~
@1321 = ~Faith is a secondary matter in Thay, but many evil powers thrive there. Cyric hath found the new following, after the Times of Troubles, as the Thayvians recognize a winner when they see one. Shar, Malar, Loviatar, and Talos art also venerated, and there art many cults devoted to Kossuth, the Elemental Lord of Fire.~
@1322 = ~During the Tuigan Invasion, the Red Wizards fought the invaders to a draw, then schemed with them to attack our land, Rashemen. 'Tis how the Red Wizard acteth: a show of force and power, followed by devious machinations. .~
@1323 = ~The nation of Thesk had long benefited from the Golden Way - the trade route from the East to the Sea of the Fallen Stars. But to its demise, the Horde used this route, to march into the heart of Faerun. Now, much of Thesk still lieth in ruin. Most of its people were sent fleeing to Impiltur by the advancing Horde.~
@1324 = ~Thesk is now plagued by the inhuman raiders, sent by Thar of Zenthil Keep to fight the Horde. They remained in the hinterland, raiding and pillaging the lands surrounding the Golden Way.~
@1325 = ~Thesk is ruled by the merchant-mayors. Telflamm, the port-city on the Sea of the Fallen Stars, and a gateway to the East doth not belong to Thesk, but its Grand Prince holds no authority beyond the city's walls. 'Tis told, that even within 'tis the merchant guilds and traders that hold the reigns, not the nobility. ~
@1326 = ~Aglarond is a small, heavily wooded and scarcely populated land. It lieth on the northern side of a peninsula that juts out into the eastern end of the Inner Sea. Jagged pinnacles of rock stand at its eastern end; to their east, these fall away into vast and treacherous marshes that largely isolate it from the mainland.~
@1327 = ~Travel in Aglarond is by griffon, ship, or forest trail. It trades lumber, gems, and some copper for glass, iron, cloth goods, and food when freetrader vessels come to port. Aglarond, however, sends out no trading ships of its own.~
@1328 = ~Aglarond cannot boast a field army of any size, nor a navy, but within its woods, the foresters art expert and deadly troops, adept at firefighting and at using coastboats handled with lateen sails, oars, and poles to raid by night. These foresters art equally well trained in treetop travel and fighting amid the foliage.~
@1329 = ~As with all the lands, that art close to Thay, Aglarond is suffering from that proximity: Skirmishes with raiders hoping to win glory for Thay, or mercenaries hired by Thay, art endless. What is worse, in Aglarond Thay sees the obstacle to their domination of the Sea of the Fallen Stars. But Aglarond holds its own against the Red Wizards. At the battles of Singing Sands and Brokenheads, Aglarond's forces turned back invading hosts from Thay, but the cost was great.~
@1330 = ~Aglarond's main strength is its ruler - the Simbul. She is a powerful mage, and her true aims art unknown. 'Tis said that she secretly roams the northern lands, seeking to influence all manner of events. Such actions art presumably to better Aglarond's safety, although the Simbul is said to be allied with the secret society known as the Harpers.~

@1332 = ~I am worried that Minsc's unfortunate condition is permanent.~
@1333 = ~We must not concern ourselves with talk, where an enemy may lurk behind any bush.~
@1334 = ~I would'st rather hear more of Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>.~
@1335 = ~My native land, Rashemen, is a long way from here, <CHARNAME>, more than a season's travel.~
@1336 = ~If thou excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I must see if Minsc's last wound requires healing. When his blood is high after combat, he oft doth not realize how badly he is hurt. ~
@1337 = ~*Your eyes find Dynaheir.*~ [DYROM2]
@1338 = ~*You walk after Dynaheir and enjoy watching her proud bearing and light steps.*~
@1339 = ~*Dynaheir's travel attire is utilitarian. A simple dress, with skirts divided for walking and running if needed. The only embellishment that you can see is an embroidered pattern running from the hem to her knee.*~
@1340 = ~*An adventurer's fare is of two sorts, as far as you are concerned. The dry and drier. Well, sometimes there is hard cheese. Far afield, you think wistfully of the deep trenchers of bread loaded with steaming meats and thick gravy, shapely yellow pears soaked in wine, quail stuffed with mushrooms, sea-fish baked with herbs, and crispy golden potatoes that Winthrop used to serve in his inn on feast days.*~
@1341 = ~Dynaheir, I just wanted to say how strange and wonderful it sounds when you address me with a heartfelt 'thou', not an empty 'ye'... dare I hope that you mean it as a sign of trust and friendship?~
@1342 = ~*You take Dynaheir's hand.*~
@1343 = ~I dreamt about you again, Dynaheir.~
@1344 = ~*Dynaheir winces and leans against a tree trunk.*~
@1345 = ~*Play with Dynaheir's hair.*~
@1346 = ~*You whisper:* "dynaheir". *The name leaves a sweet taste in your mouth.*~
@1347 = ~*Look into Dynaheir's eyes.*~
@1348 = ~I dreamt about you again, Dynaheir.~
@1349 = ~*Look at the portrait Dynaheir made.*~

@1354 = ~Oh, gods, what a miserable, dreadful, endless <DAYNIGHT>!~

@1358 = ~*Give Dynaheir a wild rose.*~
@1359 = ~*As you walk near Dynaheir, you notice that the beauty of the forest has touched her heart. She steps lightly, breathing in the smell of trees and earth. You quietly recite a poem about strolling in sylvan shadow and the beauty of the leaves overhead.*~
@1360 = ~*Walking through the city of Baldur's Gate, you pass a courtyard with an old public fountain. Dynaheir leans over it to throw water on her face. You come to sit on the rim of the white basin and look at her. Before you know it, you are murmuring the words of a poem about women, whose kisses are as desirable as cool water under the noon sun.*~
@1361 = ~*In a rare moment of peace, you see Dynaheir stop and look at the bright flowers pressed against a fence of one of the houses in the village. In her wizard's robes sewn with runes, Dynaheir herself looks like a flower. "Do not move," you say to Dynaheir, "you remind me of a poem". Line by line, you recite to her an old rhyme about a wise woman going to the market. It has a certain flirtatious flair to it that you had not noticed before.*~
@1362 = ~*You recite a verse from an epic poem that you had studied in Candlekeep under Gorion's tutelage.*~
@1363 = ~*Softly, as if musing to yourself - but making sure that Dynaheir hears - you quote a poem about eternal love.*~
@1364 = ~Dynaheir, our relationship seems to be becoming more than friendship. You are and you will always be my valued friend and companion, but I don't want to take it further than that.~
@1365 = ~Dynaheir, I like you very much, but, please, don't flirt with me anymore.~
@1366 = ~*Say nothing. Do nothing. Sometimes it's best.*~

@1369 = ~By birth, I am neither proud, nor noble, nor even rich, but a monster with a heart of murder...~
@1370 = ~Yes, for I do not know whither my taint will lead me. What if I go mad and start killing both friend and foe? Then those whom I love, those closest to me, would suffer the most. For they would not expect such treachery, such a vile attack... ~
@1371 = ~My sire forced women to lie with him, so he could beget children on them. That's not exactly an ideal example of courtship.~

@1374 = ~I... I had not thought of that.~
@1375 = ~We are talking about the things that are better left unsaid. Much as I treasure my ability to talk to you about anything, I am afraid that I have made a mistake by broaching it.~

@1388 = ~Oh, my love... oh, my sweet love... *Dynaheir whispers, responding with an eager and passionate kiss of her own.*~
@1389 = ~*Her upturned face is lovely between your palms. Her cheeks blush slightly and her eyes glisten, like dark pebbles on the beach kissed by the waves. Like black stars.*~
@1390 = ~*Dynaheir's narrow finger traces the line of your jaw, and she closes her eyes in delight.~
@1391 = ~One... two... *You kiss her harder until she stops counting just how many kisses you bestow on her beautiful lips, straight nose, and smooth cheeks...*~
@1392 = ~*Dynaheir's carefully made plaits come undone as you worry your hand through them. The strands as dark as night spill freely, like a veil, over her face. She lifts her hand slowly and brushes them away, so they do not come between your lips and hers.*~
@1393 = ~*Dynaheir wraps her own arms around your neck and smiles, after you have kissed her.* This is wonderful, my hero.~
@1394 = ~*Dynaheir prolongs the kiss, tasting and savoring the touch of your mouth.*~
@1395 = ~*It is as if the world comes to the standstill around you. You hear no sound, feel nothing stir, see nothing but Dynaheir. You two are perfectly and blissfully alone, and nothing matters but your lover's kiss.*~
@1396 = ~*You become aware of Dynaheir's heartbeat. It is so rapid, so dazzlingly rapid. Your head swims. Slowly a triumphant thought forms in your mind: "I have kissed Dynaheir."*~
@1397 = ~*Dynaheir puts her narrow palm on your shoulder* I am quite warm, my friend, truly. Dost not worry thyself over it.~
@1398 = ~*Dynaheir walks after you for a time in silence. When she says something quietly, all you can hear is your own cloak flapping wildly in the wind. But you feel warmer.*~
@1399 = ~*conversationally* An old druid once told me that the way to defeat cold is to be resigned to it, the way the animals do. If it rains, he said, a fox or a rabbit dost not long for the comfort of a hovel. They accept that when 'tis blowing one gets cold, and one gets wet when 'tis raining. I wish now that I was wiser and had learned from him.~
@1400 = ~I come from a harsh land where this would be a mild day. When have I grown so accustomed to benevolent climes? Or is it that I grew accustomed to a benevolent man?~
@1401 = ~*Dynaheir takes your hand firmly in hers. With a start, you realize that she is trying to will some of her strength into you. Primitive as this communion might be, compared to the bonds of your ancient kin, you find yourself more prepared to face whatever comes your way.*~
@1402 = ~I had always thought thee true to what 'tis said of thy race: lighthearted and jovial. 'Tis so little like thee to complain.~
@1403 = ~*softly* Why would'st not thee call for us to halt and rest?~

@1405 = ~Corellon, help me! All I wanted was a bit of sympathy, not a lecture on elven spirit!~
@1406 = ~*with a sarcastic grin* Why, thank you for the advice, oh wise counselor. I would have never figured out on my own that it is time for us to rest!~
@1407 = ~Even an elf cannot stay forever blithe facing my doom.~
@1408 = ~Thou wilt find me sympathetic to thy cause, but I would'st not let thee indulge in self-pity. If thou art tired - rest. If something burdens thee - let us talk. But dost not act like a spoiled child. I am not thy mother to hide thee from reality behind my skirts.~
@1409 = ~*coldly* Shall I bring it to your attention that I grew up without the benefit of hiding behind my mother's skirts?~
@1410 = ~Alright. We rest now.~
@1411 = ~And what do you think I am doing but trying to talk to you, Dynaheir?~
@1412 = ~O, poor lamb. *Dynaheir strokes your hair a little too forcefully for the gesture to be sincere.*~
@1413 = ~*But her hand trembles lightly and each stroke becomes more and more gentle; soon nothing but caress remains in her touch.*~
@1414 = ~*Dynaheir looks at you with her mouth slightly ajar.* I am sorry. 'Twas cold-hearted of me to expect thee to be invulnerable. Thou art not made of stone... *she takes your hand* Let us talk then of... something.~
@1415 = ~*Dynaheir smiles smugly.* I am not surprised. Men can be so unwise in such simple things.~
@1416 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... I wish that I could help thee more, but alas, there is little I could do but to fight and die with thee and for thee.~
@1417 = ~*quietly* And to love thee...~
@1418 = ~Dost not invoke gods when they art powerless to help. The divine powers will grant their priests the spells, but they cannot change our circumstances. ~
@1419 = ~*crankily* What kind of gods are they, if they can't grant me a smallest wish! ~
@1420 = ~*you sigh heavily* I know...~
@1421 = ~*testily* Really. And I thought that I'm in this bind because of one particularly fecund god...~
@1422 = ~And it is better that way. I am sorry, Dynaheir, I should not have succumbed to melancholy.~
@1423 = ~What kind of a world 'twould be, if thou could'st get thy wishes by whining like an ill-raised child doth to get a sugar plum? What kind of a person would'st one become, if every want was satisfied with no effort or work on one's part?~
@1424 = ~Besides, 'tis said that one should be wary of one's wishes coming true.~
@1425 = ~This 'bind' is thy life, <CHARNAME>.~
@1426 = ~There is an old tale about a man who prayed to Ilmater and cried that his life's burdens were too heavy for him to shoulder any longer. Ilmater told him that he would show him other people's burdens and let him chose for himself.~
@1427 = ~So the man looked and found the one that appeared the easiest to him. Ilmater then told him: 'twas thine own, the one thou had'st aired a grievance about.~
@1428 = ~'Tis alright. The <DAYNIGHT> is indeed far from being agreeable.~
@1429 = ~*Dynaheir takes your hand firmly in hers. With a start, you realize that she is trying to will some of her strength into you, and, surprisingly, you find yourself more prepared to face whatever comes your way.~
@1430 = ~'Tis so little like thee to complain, <CHARNAME>.~
@1431 = ~Ye gods! All I wanted was a bit of sympathy!~
@1432 = ~*with a sarcastic grin* Why, thank you for the advice, oh wise counselor. I would have never figured it out on my own that it is time for us to rest!~
@1433 = ~*with despair* How can anyone stay jovial, facing my doom?~
@1434 = ~I hope 'twas a good dream...~
@1435 = ~*Dynaheir smiles uncomfortably.* It must be tiring that the companions of thy days haunt thy nights also by their presence. Why, thou must think me an omnipresent sprite.~
@1436 = ~If I were thee, I would'st be more concerned by the strange nightmares that thou wert having of late.~
@1437 = ~My best dreams are of you, fair lady.~
@1438 = ~I wish there was a way to share it with you, Dynaheir. But I have not come across magicks that could do such a thing. To weave a dream together... a tale where everything is possible.~
@1439 = ~I wish there was a way to share it with you, Dynaheir. Have you ever come across magicks that could do such a thing? To weave a dream together... a tale where everything is possible.~
@1440 = ~*after a pause* No, Dynaheir, it was frightening. I dreamt about losing you.~
@1441 = ~I do not remember the details, but I woke happy and refreshed.~
@1442 = ~As mine art of thee.~
@1443 = ~'Twould be interesting magic if two could'st create a dream together. I should like to ruminate on such an enchantment. Dost thou wish to meditate on this together?~
@1444 = ~But of course. Even if we should not succeed, I dare say the time will be pleasantly spent.~
@1445 = ~Maybe. If we have sufficient time and ample supplies of spell components.~
@1446 = ~No offense, but I prefer to work alone, Dynaheir.~
@1447 = ~'Tis doubtlessly so.~
@1448 = ~As thou wish, but I dare hope that thou would'st share the results of thy deliberations on the subject; and so I would too. Thou hast picked my curiosity.~
@1449 = ~I would have liked that very much, <CHARNAME>.~
@1450 = ~*quietly* I thought that a tale where everything is possible unfolds around us as we speak. Our tale, <CHARNAME>.~
@1451 = ~None that I know of, but I would very much like to create such an enchantment. Thou hast picked my curiosity.~
@1452 = ~*Dynaheir appears to be startled for a moment, then lays her hand lightly on your shoulder.* Let us not speak of such ill things.~
@1453 = ~*She speaks aside, not meaning it for you to overhear.* Dost he has a gift of foreboding, or was it a lover's nightmare?~
@1454 = ~It gladdens my heart to hear that, my hero.~
@1455 = ~*Dynaheir's lips curve into a teasing smile.* It must be tiring when the companions of thy days haunt thy nights also by their presence. Why, thou must think me an omnipresent spirit.~
@1456 = ~*you grin* Of course I do, my spirit!~
@1457 = ~I do not mind it one single bit, my love!~
@1458 = ~Tiring? No... I have chosen you to be the companion of my days and my nights. I am happy to extend our union into the dream world. I cannot get enough of you.~
@1459 = ~Ah, well... er... perhaps.~
@1460 = ~'Tis better than the nightmares.~
@1461 = ~*she matches your grin* And here I thought that thou had encouraged our closeness. How sadly I was mistaken!~
@1462 = ~'Tis settled, then. I should follow thee be it to the end of Toril or beyond -~
@1463 = ~*quietly, she adds* For as long as I am able. ~
@1464 = ~*Dynaheir looks at you very directly. She holds your gaze while she speaks evenly.* And I can not get enough of thee.~
@1465 = ~If I were thee, I would be more concerned-~
@1466 = ~No, I am not thee, and I wish that thou had more peaceful dreams, as befitting a regular man of thine age.~
@1467 = ~*she smiles amusedly* Even if I should appear in them dressed scantily, or not dressed at all.~
@1468 = ~So, thou art a romantic as well as a woodsman? Some would say 'tis a desirable combination in a man.~
@1469 = ~In the forest, my fair lady, I can provide food for both your stomach and your soul.~
@1470 = ~Some would say so, yes. What do you think, Dynaheir?~
@1471 = ~*You make a show of being so immersed in the poem that you do not hear her question.*~
@1472 = ~*She laughs lightly.*~
@1473 = ~*very seriously* I agree.~
@1474 = ~I have no love for generalities, <CHARNAME>. *after a short pause* But it suits thee.~
@1475 = ~*She looks at you in wonder.* 'Thou art so much at ease here, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis quite heartening.~
@1476 = ~Such beautiful words can sooth the most troubled soul. Just like a walk in the forest.~
@1477 = ~The leaves art lovely indeed. Thank thee for sharing what was in thy heart.~
@1478 = ~*Dynaheir splashes water at you playfully.*~
@1479 = ~*Dynaheir leans toward you, and her cool lips find yours in a brief kiss.*~
@1480 = ~*Dynaheir arches a brow.* The way thou read it... ~
@1481 = ~I know it is strange... I had not thought it had a double meaning, either. Perhaps that is because I have never before read it to a woman I desired.~
@1482 = ~You said it, not I.~
@1483 = ~*In a tone brooking no argument.* That's how it's always been read.~
@1484 = ~Mayhap neither have I heard it from a man I desired.~
@1485 = ~'Tis a likely reason.~
@1486 = ~*With a distracted gesture, Dynaheir picks a flower. The petals fall on her skirt and her feet, as she tears them away. It is an old game that maidens play, trying to guess if they are being courted or not.*~
@1487 = ~*She arches a mocking eyebrow at you.* Why, 'tis quite a speech from thee.~
@1488 = ~*Dynaheir nods in rhythm with the poem, and smiles widely at you when you finish. She looks lovely, and you could almost forget that you face a powerful mage.*~
@1489 = ~*Dynaheir listens attentively, and at one point you are sure that she was about to correct a small inaccuracy in your recital, but she does not. She nods her approval briefly, once you are finished.*~
@1490 = ~Impressive that thou hadst remembered it just now, when our own lives art in peril. 'Tis what I often do, for songs like this one bestir the heart.~
@1491 = ~If Dynaheir heard your musings, she gave no sign of it. Yet her features soften, and she assumes a look that you have come to think of as "tender thoughtfulness". At moments like this, you can almost feel the warmth that washes over you when she glances your way.*~
@1492 = ~Love eternal... *she sighs* Thou art so young, yet.~
@1493 = ~*quietly* Or is it I who allowed my soul to grow calloused? ~
@1494 = ~And dost thou want it? The love eternal?~
@1495 = ~Yes, of course.~
@1496 = ~No, but it is a pretty verse, my lady Dynaheir.~
@1497 = ~I have the same attitude towards it, as I have to death. I do not seek it, but if it comes, I will be ready for it.~
@1498 = ~*smile quizzically* Sorceress, allow me to keep my secrets.~
@1499 = ~*wonderingly* Thou speak with true conviction. May the blessing of the Three rest upon thee.~
@1500 = ~Yes, quite pretty.~
@1501 = ~*she chuckles amusedly* Silly boy, thou canst not be prepared for the coming of either one.~
@1502 = ~*Dynaheir walks closer to you and listens... she takes your hand briefly in her slender palms and says nothing, just holds it and makes you stop. As you turn to her, she rests her cheek briefly - no longer than a heartbeat - against your chest.*~
@1503 = ~*You try to pull her closer.*~
@1504 = ~*You drop your fingers into her dark mane and stroke her hair lightly.*~

@1509 = ~*Dynaheir lifts her head and looks up into your eyes dreamily.*~
@1510 = ~Why, this is a red dragon bloom. I have seen the red dyes that the gnomes of Cormyr make from its petals. I have used it to mix inks in various shades of red. 'Twas quite interesting.~
@1511 = ~*Dynaheir fixes the flower in her hair.* 'Tis very beautiful.~
@1512 = ~*Dynaheir twirls the flower in front of her face, seemingly enjoying its color and fragrance, but you notice that for a moment her lips touch it in a gentle kiss.* ~
@1513 = ~'Tis shepherd's luck flower - I have seen the drawings in the herbalist's scrolls. 'Tis so called because of its shade that shepherds love, and if I am not mistaken, 'tis more common to the North from here. But if a tree grows, it grows, and asks for no sage's advice.~
@1514 = ~What a charming woodbell! I have read that it is sometimes called Mielikki's Eyes, and hunters believe that it brings good luck.~
@1515 = ~Ah, Master Bard, dost thou want to remind me of thy songs whence thou called me a wild rose? Vanity is not befitting to a man of thine years.*~
@1516 = ~*She puts the flower gingerly in her journal. There is little doubt in your mind that it will be kept with her scrolls.*~
@1517 = ~*Murmuring about silliness and space, Dynaheir tosses out a few shreds of some mysterious herb, no doubt a spell ingredient, from a small pouch, and puts the bloom inside.*~
@1518 = ~*The flower nests between Dynaheir's breasts pinned to the corsage of her robes for the rest of the day.*~
@1519 = ~*Dynaheir firmly returns flower to you.* In Rashemen the custom is that women give flowers to the mighty heroes, <CHARNAME>. ~
@1520 = ~*Balancing herself on one foot, she starts to pull down her knee high boot.*~
@1521 = ~Allow me, Dynaheir.~

@1524 = ~Dynaheir, do not fall behind too much!~
@1525 = ~*Dynaheir stops her jerking and jumping and extends her foot forward.*~
@1526 = ~*You kneel in front of her and diligently pull the boot off. You shake out a small stone.* Here you go.~
@1527 = ~*You kneel in front of her and start pulling the boot down, as slowly as you can.*~

@1538 = ~*To your surprise, Dynaheir giggles as girlishly as Imoen would.* Ah, leave that, <CHARNAME>, I am ticklish!~
@1539 = ~*you grin* I shall remember that for the future.~
@1540 = ~*The ring would be a plain thing, if not for a pattern etched into it. It consists of a multitude of segments, each one having minute differences from the others. After a moment's deliberation, you conclude that the image is that of a snake.*~
@1541 = ~I see that thou art curious about my ring. 'Tis an antiquity from Matzica I have acquired in my travels. The symbol is that of infinity, and that of the interconnection of all things in the world. The snake is supposedly feathered, uniting the sky and the underworld.~
@1542 = ~*Dynaheir's slender foot finds its way into the boot. You chalk up the toe ring as another mystery attached to this woman.*~
@1543 = ~'Tis just a stone. *Dynaheir continues jerking the boot irritably, and it flies up, dropping down to the ground a few paces away from her. With an exasperated sigh she clutches at her tree* Would'st thou...~
@1544 = ~Would'st I... what, Dynaheir? ~
@1545 = ~Of course! Sorry for standing here, gawking. *You collect the boot and bring it back to Dynaheir.*~

@1567 = ~Perhaps I should. Then both of us will be acting like fools. ~
@1568 = ~*She lowers her eyes.* Yes, yes... thank thee.~
@1569 = ~*Without looking at you, Dynaheir mumbles.* Here is the culprit...~
@1570 = ~No, I simply adore leaning on trees and going barefoot for no apparent reason.~
@1571 = ~Really? I'll leave you to it then. Just don't fall behind too much.~
@1572 = ~Me too! Why won't we run barefoot together?~
@1573 = ~Wait! Wouldst thou... help me?~
@1574 = ~By the Three! I have no business running about barefoot with the would-be hero of the Sword Coast! ~
@1575 = ~*You notice that Dynaheir's pack is not properly adjusted on her back, and will eventually cause her discomfort.*~
@1576 = ~*You come up to Dynaheir from behind and re-adjust the strap.*~

@1579 = ~Thank thee kindly, <CHARNAME>. *She casts a grateful, if surprised, glance your way.*~
@1580 = ~*Taken unawares as you handle her pack, Dynaheir missteps, stumbles and sways back. You are in a perfect position to help her keep her balance.*~
@1581 = ~*You catch Dynaheir in your arms, ignoring her pack's impact on your chest.*~
@1582 = ~*You sidestep and grab Dynaheir by one shoulder, stabilizing her.*~
@1583 = ~*You ignore the woman's plight. Huh, you've already done enough.*~
@1584 = ~By the Three! Be careful, <CHARNAME>!~
@1585 = ~*Almost tenderly, though with a slightly mocking edge to her voice.* However art we to keep thee alive, if thou aim to do the assassin's work thyself?~
@1586 = ~*It may just be your imagination, but for a short moment, Dynaheir seems to linger, as if savoring the touch of your hand.*~
@1587 = ~*Dynaheir pats your hand that holds her shoulder.* Thank thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1588 = ~*hotly* Thou art impossible!~
@1589 = ~*She chuckles slightly and raises one brow at you.*~
@1590 = ~*A small smile appears at the corner of her lips.* The last time I was subject to such an offer, 'twas from Gvidon, a valiant lad of thirteen - who then placed a rather ugly toad upon my palms.~
@1591 = ~Oh, well, nothing quite so exciting. I simply wanted to readjust a strap on your pack. It is too loose - the weight is distributed unevenly.~

@1596 = ~*your mouth suddenly dry, you take your hand away and whisper* Just so.~
@1597 = ~*You pat the pack and smile widely.* Now you are all set to march on.~
@1598 = ~*Dynaheir pulls on the straps tentatively, readjusting the load.* Yes, yes... Thou art right: 'tis much improved.~
@1599 = ~We, witches, deal with toads daily. And with bats, lizards, porcupines and rats - on occasion. 'Twill take much worse a thing than a toad to make me scream.~
@1600 = ~Of course. I simply wanted to readjust a strap on your pack. It is too loose - the weight is distributed unevenly.~
@1601 = ~*Dynaheir makes a slight move, as if to shake your fingers off - then freezes in place with a sigh, as you caress her ear.*~
@1602 = ~*Dynaheir swallows, as if her throat too is parched.* Just so.~
@1603 = ~*Dynaheir looks straight at you, and notices you perusing her lips.* I see. Thank thee.~
@1604 = ~*Not for the first time, you notice a hint of sadness.*~

@1606 = ~*Leave it be.*~
@1607 = ~There once was a Cormyrian wizard who employed his magic in ways that displeased his superiors - namely, for pranks. So they called him in regulary for chastisement; but nothing seemed to work. Once, a very frustrated official caught up with him on the street, and asked how so many reprimands and punishments could go unnoticed. The wizard replied, 'Oh, 'tis not entirely wasted: each simulacrum I sent to your office came back a completely changed man!'~
@1608 = ~A human merchant passed away, and it turned out that he had changed his faith many a time. Gods turned him into a bone of contention, arguing over who should take his soul. After listening for a time, the merchant spoke. 'Listen, I hate to be such a bother. Let's make a deal: I promise to pick only one of you, and stick with my choice for all of fifty years... and all that one has to do is resurrect me.'~
@1609 = ~A young bard had an argument with his friend, a mage's apprentice. The apprentice said an intelligent man could invent plenty of sure ways to attract any young maiden's favor. The bard argued that such surety is impossible, and not the work of mere intelligence, besides. Suddenly, a beautiful lady walked into the tavern, where they had been lounging, and the bard challenged the mageling to a dare. The apprentice created a bouquet of phantasmal flowers and sent them over with a note that read: 'if your soul is as beautiful and extravagant as these flowers, you will be interested in your secret admirer.' Another note came in reply, just as quickly. It started with: 'no woman wants a man, whose feelings are as pompous and artificial as these flowers.' ~

@1629 = ~*She closes her eyes for a moment, and looks away.* A penance for the little traitors is that they should not look upon thee for a time.~
@1630 = ~I wish I had thought on that when I was a novice.~
@1631 = ~Once a merchant, always a merchant. I would have thought the Wall of Faithlessness to be reserved for such men.~
@1632 = ~I do not believe that any man could truly understand a woman thus, and I hold it true likewise, that a woman could not thusly perceive a man.~
@1633 = ~Still, 'tis an amusing story. Quite amusing. *Dynaheir rewards you for your efforts with a smile, one that gives her eyes an especially warm glow.*~
@1634 = ~*Dynaheir chews on her lips, and a concerned expression returns to her face*~
@1635 = ~*Dynaheir turns to you with a gentle and understanding glance. When she speaks, her voice is filled with care.* Thou art far kinder than thou mayst wish to appear, my love.~
@1636 = ~*Dynaheir squints at you for a brief moment and chuckles, then gives your hand a little squeeze.*~

@1657 = ~Well then, 'tis indeed the best there is. *She flashes a prideful but playful grin.*~

@1660 = ~Thou might get there yet, for he who fights the monsters... ~
@1661 = ~Hmph... That could be arranged. *She waves her hands and the drawing comes alive. Fire leaps in 'your' eyes, the face twists in an ugly grimace, skin cracks and smokes...~

@1663 = ~Because my throat is sore from the cries of battle.~
@1664 = ~Because my throat went dry, shouting in battle...~

@1667 = ~I am working my way through the full range. Last time, I shouted at the top of my lungs... it is time now for a quiet, contemplative "dynaheir"...~
@1668 = ~Then it shalt be soothed. *She kisses your neck, warming your throat...*~
@1669 = ~Thou art sore, and still thou dost call upon thy Dynaheir? Mine hero! Such hardiness deserveth a reward. *She caresses your cheek.*~

@1705 = ~*She smiles warmly.* Is it so?~
@1706 = ~I am sure that task be not insurmountable, for a bard of thy talent.~
@1707 = ~*She says nothing, but will not take her hand away. For a few moments, you walk side by side - as if you are just another pair of young lovers in a place as peaceful as Elysium. This casual stroll is both pleasant and strange, when you return to your reality full of battles.*~
@1708 = ~*With unexpected shyness, Dynaheir slides her cool hand out of your palm. It is like snow that you tried to hold, but that slipped through your fingers as it turned to water.* ~
@1709 = ~*Dynaheir takes your hand in both of hers, and turns it to bring your palm facing upwards. With a smile, she traces lines.* ~

@1712 = ~*You stay silent.*~

@1715 = ~There, as nice and cryptic as any diviner.~
@1716 = ~That thou must yearn to bathe, <CHARNAME>!~
@1717 = ~*She shakes her head in disbelief.* Who would have thought that a veteran of so many battles is ticklish.~
@1718 = ~Truly, the greatest hath the most trivial fears. I am starting to believe that Tethir the Dragonslayer was afraid of cockroaches.~
@1719 = ~Thou hath a victor's hands, <CHARNAME>, and a ruler's. Let them be generous, willing to mete out justice, and to defend innocence and righteousness!~
@1720 = ~'Tis true that I value thy companionship.~
@1721 = ~Thou dost give such words too much power. Mine actions speak louder of mine allegiance and loyalties.~
@1722 = ~By the Three, but someone in this land doth not find my speech strange! 'Tis... 'tis pleasing.~
@1723 = ~Art thou unsure?~
@1724 = ~No, no. It's just that sometimes it sounds... er... strange. I wish that you could simply address me as 'you'.~
@1725 = ~There was a bard once who wondered:

'Why did we switch from ye to thou?
O, we have reaped our rewards ... ~

@1731 = ~Doubt not my friendship, <CHARNAME> - and for its sake, allow me what thou might consider... peculiar? As friends oft do for each other.~
@1732 = ~Where is Rashemen, Dynaheir?~
@1733 = ~'Tis far beyond the bounds of thy map, <CHARNAME>. *She sighs.* I am far away from my homeland, indeed.~
@1734 = ~Well, OK then. *You roll the map up.*~
@1735 = ~Do you... do you regret coming this far?~
@1736 = ~It is just that my map is too small, Dynaheir. In Candlekeep, there were maps on which Rashemen was close enough to the Sword Coast.~
@1737 = ~No. *Dynaheir looks at you in such a way... it becomes apparent to you that she meant something more than being far from her homeland.* ~
@1738 = ~The lust for wandering is the most difficult one to satiate, <CHARNAME>. Once thou hast felt it for the first time, thou art doomed to wander far and wide. 'Tis useless to regret it. ~
@1739 = ~Why, thank thee, <CHARNAME>, for putting it that way. ~
@1740 = ~*she murmurs* Yes, for if something was meant to come together, 'twill come together... The distance is of little consequence, within the great scale of things.~
@1741 = ~*Dynaheir's eyes wander the breadth of the map for a short moment. As her glance slides past its eastern edge, she speaks firmly.* There art more pressing matters closer to thy home that await our attention, <CHARNAME>.~

@1743 = ~What say you about our current situation, then?~
@1744 = ~*Dynaheir lifts the map off of your knee and puts it on the ground. She produces a quill from her pocket, and starts drawing the lands beyond the map's scope...* Here lie Amn, and Tethyr, and Calimshan... Here is the Sea of Fallen Stars, and a peninsula that hosts Aglarond. Here is Thay and Namarra and Rashemen... *Caught up in the sound of her voice, you barely notice that the softly glowing lines she draws hang in the air, like a sort of web...*~
@1745 = ~Oh, Dynaheir, it's fascinating!~
@1746 = ~So that's where Rashemen is... Thank you, Dynaheir.~
@1747 = ~*Infected by the mood of travel and discovery, you urge Dynaheir to add cities, rivers and strongholds of Rashemen...*~
@1748 = ~*Dynaheir waves her hand in the air, and the glowing web dissipates...*~
@1749 = ~*Dynaheir passes you the quill.* Mayhap thou couldst draw Candlekeep for me?~
@1750 = ~*You draw your childhood home, the fortress above the sea cliffs. You show Dynaheir the pentagon of outer walls, the blind one facing the sea, and the solitary gate opposite to it. Then the inner wall, and the main keep with its eleven towers. The gardens and the fountains. The tall temple of Oghma... Winthrop's Inn... The memories flow from within you, and you start recounting the personages and stories of your childhood. ~
@1751 = ~*You draw the fortress on the cliff. Here is the pentagon of the outer walls, with its blind wall turned toward the sea, and the only gate opposite to it. Then there is the inner wall and the main keep with its eleven towers. The gardens and the fountains. The tall temple of Oghma... Winthrop's Inn... The memories flood you, and you check yourself. It's all irrelevant now. ~
@1752 = ~Maybe another time, Dynaheir.~
@1753 = ~*To your surprise and delight, Dynaheir does not seem bored stiff by your account. She nods as you go on, and laughs at what you yourself think to be funny. A warm feeling washes over you.*~
@1754 = ~*Dynaheir frowns at the forested area so close to Baldur's Gate itself.* The Cloakwood mine is well hidden in these woods. One wouldst never have guessed that it could lie amidst the domain of druids. 'Tis cunning of thine adversary to have found it and used it for his schemes. I wonder, how he hast come upon such intelligence, such resources, in the first place?~
@1755 = ~I share thy fascination, <CHARNAME>... *She traces the contour of the jagged shore on the map lovingly, and for a brief moment your hands touch. Her slender fingers flutter slightly, before resuming their course from Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate.*~
@1756 = ~*She smiles back at you.* I could almost pretend that we wert children, butting our heads together, dreaming of experiencing faraway lands. *She grows serious.* Bookish children, overwhelmed by the vastness of the world for the first time. But 'tis not so... ~
@1757 = ~I remember myself at that age... I pored over maps and swallowed bards' tales. How I tried to understand what true combat feels like, when Jondalar showed me my first forms with a wooden training sword! How I listened to strangers that came to see Gorion, and tried to puzzle out what intrigue is, and what is a plot... How I imitated it in my childish games, swearing that an Evil Overlord's trail will not grow cold... and that I will forever love the fairest of maidens...~
@1758 = ~But we can pretend... just for a moment, Dynaheir... *You lean closer, and butt the side of your head slightly against hers.*~
@1759 = ~*thoughtfully, as if reciting a poem she once loved, but had almost forgotten* ...and it tasted bittersweet, like the waters of the Lake of Tears - like a victory dearly bought, like the kiss of parting lovers...~
@1760 = ~*You slide your forehead against her cheek and her neck... Her skin is warm, and her hair fragrant.*~
@1761 = ~*She laughs.* Such a glint I see in thine eyes! And one might have thought, after what thou hast been through, thou wouldst be less excitable about maps and tales. But there hideth joy and curiosity within thee, that I think no hardship could extinguish. 'Tis good...~
@1762 = ~*Dynaheir sits down for a moment, and some fanciful stitching in her dress catches your attention.*~

@1774 = ~*Dynaheir does not appear to notice.*~
@1775 = ~*Dynaheir firmly removes your hand from her knee.*~
@1776 = ~*She raises her brows slightly.*~
@1777 = ~*This indication of puzzlement is enough to make you blush, and you pull your hand away.*~
@1778 = ~*You smirk and roguishly raise one brow in response.*~
@1779 = ~*You give Dynaheir's knee another gentle stroke, freeing it from the last bit of silk, then quickly lean over and kiss it.*~
@1780 = ~*Pointedly, Dynaheir moves away.*~
@1781 = ~*You sigh.*~
@1782 = ~*You scratch the back of your head, puzzled.*~
@1783 = ~*You call after her, ready to apologize.*~
@1784 = ~*Dynaheir rises to her feet and stalks away, her hands gripping her skirts tightly. She does not give you a tongue-lashing, though. You do not know if she is angry with you, or confused.*~
@1785 = ~*Dynaheir spreads the hem of her skirt between her fingers and looks at the complex curvilinear pattern, with interwoven vines, leaves and flowers - then nods.* Yes, <CHARNAME>, 'tis a traditional pattern. The Tree of Life they call it, and 'tis done in satin stitch, if I am not mistaken. But surely, embroidery can wait. There art many other things we must discuss before advancing to cut velvets, couched pearls and brocades.~

@1788 = ~*Dynaheir looks up at you and frowns.*~
@1789 = ~*Dynaheir looks up, and for a moment her eyes meet yours. A deep blush creeps up her cheeks as well... then she smiles vaguely, and readjusts her skirts.*~

@1791 = ~*Dynaheir stands up deliberately.* 'Twas enough... resting. ~
@1792 = ~<CHARNAME>? Art thou daydreaming?~
@1793 = ~*You chase the thoughts away, as every responsible party leader should.*~
@1794 = ~*You sigh, and sink your teeth into a piece of flatbread with the determination of a martyr.*~
@1795 = ~*you mutter* Blood and flatbread day in and day out: oh, the horrible reality of adventuring!~

@1891 = ~When asked about her past, FALDORN states that she was the child of a Black Raven Uthgardt woman. As an infant she was given over to an enclave of Shadow Druids as an offering, and was thereafter raised according to their beliefs. A splinter group of the main druidic order, Shadow Druids engage in very aggressive protection of nature, often relying on violence to achieve their aims. Faldorn showed great promise as she approached adulthood, and the order decided to send her to the Sword Coast to test her devotion to their ideals. Her ongoing mission is to use any means available to stop the despoiling of nature, no matter the risk or the cost to her life or any other.~ [DUMMYSND]

@1900 = ~Ah, very fitting indeed.~
@1901 = ~So what is your real name, then? Do you know?~

@1909 = ~Uhm, yes.~
@1910 = ~I do not see a connection you are suggesting, to be honest...~

@1927 = ~If the Great Mother would call upon me to serve her in this way, and you are the strongest male in our pack, I will howl for you when I am fertile.~

@1930 = ~That's too many ifs for my taste, Faldorn. How about we give it a go next time we stop, and don't let the mom know?~

@2077 = ~Als Ihr JAHEIRA nach ihrer Vergangenheit fragt, funkeln ihre Augen vor Zorn. Sie erzählt, sie wurde in der Region Tethyr als Kind eines dem König Alemander treu Ergebenen geboren, leider während des Bürgerkriegs. Ihre Familie gehörte zu den Adligen, die sich der wütende Mob von Bauern als Ziel ausgesucht hatte, und sie wurde nur deswegen verschont, weil eine Dienerin sie aus der Burg brachte, bevor diese in sich zusammenfiel. Sie flüchteten sich in den Wald von Tethyr und gerieten zufällig an eine Enklave von Druiden, die das Kind gerne aufnahmen. Jaheira wurde ein sehr willensstarkes Mädchen, das glaubte, dass die einzige Möglichkeit, die Natur zu schützen, darin bestand, eine aktive Rolle in der Welt zu übernehmen. Sie scheint nicht viel mit Khalid gemein zu haben, doch obwohl sie gerne mit ihm streitet, ist sie ihm anscheinend tief zugetan. Ihr spürt eine große Bewunderung für Gorion, und sie sagt ganz offen, dass der für seinen Tod Verantwortliche ein ähnliches Schicksal erleiden wird.~ [DUMMYSND]

@2095 = ~Was wollt Ihr wissen, <CHARNAME>? Ein paar Dinge aus meiner Vergangenheit? Ich wurde in Tethyr geboren und wurde von einem Dienstmädchen fortgebracht, während der Rest meiner Familie im jüngsten Bürgerkrieg verschwand. Sie bracht mich in einen Druidenhain, wo ich aufgezogen wurde; ich lernte den Wald und seine Bewohner zu schützen. Ich traf Gorion und Khalid lange danach. Und das muss reichen, Eure Neugier zu befriedigen, <CHARNAME>.~
@2096 = ~<CHARNAME>, psst. Es könnten Gefahren in der Nähe lauern.~

@2152 = ~Als Ihr KIVAN nach seiner Vergangenheit fragt, erfahrt Ihr, dass er aus dem Wald von Shilmista stammt. Er hat seine Heimat jedoch seit geraumer Zeit nicht mehr gesehen. Stattdessen reist er um die Welt, getrieben vom übelsten Verlangen: dem Verlangen nach Rache. Vor einigen Jahren wurden Kivan und seine Gefährtin Deheriana anscheinend auf einer romantischen Reise von Räubern überfallen. Zur Belustigung von Tazok, dem Halboger, der diesen Überfall anführte, wurden sie gefangen genommen und gefoltert. Kivan konnte schließlich entkommen, doch Deheriana musste diese Begegnung mit dem Leben bezahlen. Kivan ist kein Mann großer Worte und ihm fällt es offenbar schwer, Freundschaften zu schließen. Solange er nicht den Tod seiner Liebsten gerächt hat, wird er dem Leben kaum große Freuden abgewinnen können.~ [DUMMYSND]

@2235 = ~[MINSC 37] Sucht Euch Eure Freunde genau aus. Nicht alle sind so vertrauenswürdig wie Minsk und Boo.~ [%tutu_var%MINSC37]
@2236 = ~[MINSC 40] Es gibt keinen schöneren Ort zum Sterben als auf dem Schlachtfeld.~ [%tutu_var%MINSC40]
@2237 = ~[MINSC 41] Dynaheir! Neiiiiin! Ich werde Euch rächen!!!~ [%tutu_var%MINSC41]
@2238 = ~[MINSC 34] Ich bin kein Mann großer Worte und fackele nicht lange! Genug der Warnung, Ihr werdet sterben!~ [%tutu_var%MINSC34]

@2241 = ~Als Ihr MINSK nach seiner Vergangenheit fragt, verkündet er stolz, ein Berserkerkrieger aus dem fernöstlichen Rashemen zu sein. Er befindet sich zurzeit auf seiner Daschemma, einer rituelle Reise in die Männlichkeit. Dabei ist er auf Abenteuer und Kampfesruhm aus. Er hat außerdem die Ehre, der Leibwächter einer jungen Wychlaran aus Rashemen namens Dynaheir zu sein. Sollte man ihr Schaden zufügen wollen, so ist er fest entschlossen, einem so lange Verstand einzuprügeln, bis man es sich anders überlegt. Er fragt sich, warum Dynaheir sie an die Schwertküste geführt hat, doch seine Loyalität kann durch nichts erschüttert werden. Wenn sie mit seinen Diensten zufrieden ist und er sich im Kampf einen Namen macht, hofft er, in die Berserkerloge der Eisdrachen aufgenommen zu werden, wenn er in die Heimat zurückkehrt. Als bislang größte Erfahrung, die er in der großen, weiten Welt gemacht hat, sieht Minsk den Erwerb seines kleinen Begleiters Boo an. Nach seinen Worten handelt es sich dabei um einen Miniaturriesenweltraumhamster. Solche Dinge sollen in den Vergessenen Reichen tatsächlich existieren, doch Minsk hat mit Sicherheit schon zu oft eins auf die Rübe bekommen. Er scheint ein gutmütiger Kerl zu sein, doch gewinnt seine Berserkernatur etwas zu oft die Oberhand.~ [DUMMYSND]
@2242 = ~Ein wenig Fachkenntnis, die funktioniert, ist sehr viel besser als eine Menge Fachkenntnis, die nutzlos ist. Minsk schätzt, dass <CHARNAME> besser eine Menge mehr 'funktionieren' sollte!~

@2244 = ~Ihr hättet zuhören sollen, als Boo sprach, <CHARNAME>. Ich kann keine weisen Dinge sagen, wie Boo es tut. Manchmal wünschte ich, dass die Worte von Boo nicht nur für Minsk allein wären.~
@2245 = ~Er, der jene erschlägt, die erschlagen werden müssen, kann nichts falsche tun!~
@2246 = ~Macht Euch nicht so viele Gedanken, <CHARNAME>. Wenn die Schwertschneide in Eure Innereien stösst, dann denkt daran wie Narben einen Krieger stolz machen!~

@2249 = ~Ich wäre erfreut, wenn ich <CHARNAME> sagen könnte, was zu tun ist, wenn es etwas mit Tieren oder Kämpfen wäre. Aber <CHARNAME> hat dieses Funkeln in den Augen, also denket Minsk, <PRO_ERSIE> möchte über Strategie und Taktik reden und andere Dinge, in denen Minsk nicht so stark ist...~
@2250 = ~Boo fragt nach unserer Hexe. Es erfüllt mich mit Zorn, wenn ich darüber nachdenke, was passieren könnte! Und Boo auch!~
@2251 = ~Boo sagt, dass Verderben des Eisenerzes keine einfache Angelegenheit ist, und dass <CHARNAME> jenen finden muss, der hinter dem steht. Und ich werde dessen Hintern treten! Viele gute Dinge sind aus Eisen gemacht.~
@2252 = ~Etwas abgundtief Böses wartet am Boden einer Grube. Oder war es 'Böses ist eine bodenlose Grube', Boo? Sprich lauter, Du brauchst nicht schüchtern sein. Sie können Dich auf keinen Fall hören.~
@2253 = ~Banditen jagen ist großer Spaß! Boo hat eine Vorliebe für alles winzige und die Banditen sind alle groß, wenn Minsk sie tötet, dann erfreut es Boo!~
@2254 = ~Wenn Euch böse Gegner zahlenmäßig überlegen sind, dann überrascht sie!~
@2255 = ~Noch eine Mine, mehr Banditen? Boo hat das Gefühl, dass er das schonmal erledigt hat, aber wer wird sich beschweren, wenn sich solch gute Dinge wiederholen?~
@2256 = ~Mantelwald... Wald Hülle... Wald der verhüllt ist... Wenn man dem Namen trauen darf, dann kann nicht mal Minsk ihn in weniger als einer Woche durchqueren.~
@2257 = ~Viel Böses ist in dieser Stadt: Minsk wird seine Sohlen abgelaufen haben, ehe wir hier fertig sind! Boo, denkst Du, dass ich neue Stiefel kaufen sollte?~
@2258 = ~Boo sagt, es gibt hier mehr Zwei-Beiner in diese Stadt als es Gesichter gibt.~
@2259 = ~Boo denkt, dass wir ganz schön in der Klemme stecken. Zu schade, dass diese Männer dort nicht seine Nase für Böses haben!~
@2260 = ~Boo fragt sich, ob <CHARNAME> das feine Muster in unseren Bewegungen sieht: Kerzenburg-Baldurs Tor-Kerzenburg...~
@2261 = ~Das ist kein guter Zeitpunkt für Beistand! Boo schärft seine Zähne für die große Schlacht!~
@2262 = ~Er, der mit Monstern kämpft, möge Acht geben, sonst wird er dabei selbst ein Monster. Ist das Leben nicht hundertmal zu kurz für uns, um uns zu langweilen?~

@2266 = ~Schwerter, nicht Gedanken! Oder Gedaken über Schwerter. Na, richtig, Boo?~
@2267 = ~Ich habe bald keine Sonnenblumenkerne mehr! Können wir ein paar Xvarte töten? Boo mag Xvartaugen.~
@2268 = ~Minsk ist mächtig mit dem Schwert. Das Denken überlässt er den Weisen, wie Gorion, oder Dynaheir, oder Boo.~
@2269 = ~Minsk mag diese Wände nicht und die niedrigen Decken. Es ist, als würden sie ihn einschränken und einsperren wollen.~
@2270 = ~Diese bösen Feinde sind gut! Äh... Minsk meint, sie kämpfen gut. Aber nichts hält Minsk und Boo aus! Nichtmal das sehr gute Böse... Arrgh!~
@2271 = ~Minsk weiß nicht, was er tun soll: er kann sein Gesicht nicht in der Eis-Berserker-Halle zeigen! Seine Hexe ist tot!~
@2272 = ~Es ist nicht dasselbe ohne meine Hexe. Aber Boo sagt mir stets, dass Dynaheir es wollen würde, dass ich weiter äh,... 'die Mächte des Bösen in Schach halte'... Minsk denkt, dass das Hintern treten damit gemeint ist.~
@2273 = ~Minsk sieht den Roten Zauberer dort, seine Hexe betrachten. Minsk traut ihm kein bischen!

@2274 = ~<CHARNAME> möchte mehr über Minsk erfahren! Minsk ist auf seinem Dajemma, um seine Männlichkeit zu beweisen und in die Eisdrachen-Berserker -Halle aufgenommen zu werden, wenn er nach Rashemen zurück kehrt. Er kämpft tapfer für seine Hexe. Möchte <CHARNAME> auch etwas über Boo wissen? Er ist ein Miniaturriesenweltraumhamster. Man kann sie in Sembia kaufen, auf dem Marktplatz, von einem alten Kerl mit Bart, spitzem Hut und einer Pfeife. Minsk hat all sein Erspartes ausgegeben, um Boo zu kaufen. Aber was ist ein Mann ohne seinen Hamster? Minsk und Boo sind ein schreckliches Hintern-tretendes Duo! Tretet zurück, Schurke! Ich komme und mein Hamster mit mir!~
@2275 = ~<CHARNAME>, SHHHHH! Ihr weckt Boo noch auf! Ein großartiges Gehirn braucht die Stille, um seine Weisheit zurück zu gewinnen.~

You get the feeling, however, that no one was terribly broken up over his leaving.

@2423 = ~You will find that I make a most magnificent friend!~
@2424 = ~Indeed, just listen to my wisdom and instruction, and you will gain a great deal of knowledge. I am a priest of Barvar Cloakshadow, and a great mage besides. I, ah... mastered sorcery so quickly that the narrow-minded commoners of my village made me leave as soon as I had come of age. They could not tolerate a youngster teaching them how to do things properly, you see...~
@2425 = ~But I am glad - I was too talented to remain in the backwater. I have apprenticed under Gifos, and he himself said that I cannot be bothered with learning as all others do, so I am better off on my own acquiring the practical knowledge of magic while adventuring. Yes, he did. So now I do just that - and, to tell you the truth, I think I am now at the level when I myself can teach anyone... bah! I could have taught in the Luskan's Host Tower... as a minimum - years ago, if not for envy and intrigues...~
@2426 = ~You do not deserve a single whiff of my enormous brain... Wait! Where are you going?~
@2427 = ~I am the most intelligent being on Toril... Can you feel my amazing brain?~

@2473 = ~[TIAX 41] Ha Ha HA!  Smart guy dies, and Tiax goes on to RULE!~ [%tutu_var%TIAXX41]
@2474 = ~[TIAX 32] Your insults carry little sting.  Tiax knows he will rule in the end.~ [%tutu_var%TIAXX32]

@2477 = ~When asked about his past TIAX ignores you entirely, preferring instead to loudly proclaim what is in store for his future. He obviously worships Cyric, but also seems to share a touch of his madness.

@2496 = ~Hmm, you're not as dull as Tiax thought you were. Very well, you are being offered the position of Tiax's personal servant, with a rare privilege of polishing Tiax's nails and telling him bedtime stories! And they'd better be good bedtime stories, for Tiax's wrath will be great if they are not!~
@2497 = ~Tiax agrees! <CHARNAME> therefore is made Tiax's personal public crier!~
@2498 = ~The heavens will shatter, and the Nine Hells will freeze when Tiax rules! Oh, and there will be chocolate plants everywhere. Yes, mustn't forget the chocolate plants~

@2500 = ~Tiax will crush Ao, make Mystra his bedchamber slave, throw Helm off the stairs, and put Cyric into his proper er um never mind.~
@2501 = ~Tiax's slaves will build a castle of his enemies' skulls on the top of mount Celestia, and make a path to this castle from their bones! And then he will rule!~

@2503 = ~Tiax is destined to lead, though he grows to enjoy your company... Perhaps you shall be spared his wrath, and appointed to more than sewage detail.~
@2504 = ~How did great Tiax come to Cyric's fold? Tiax once was a miserable gnome, and was called... Telliax Goldstone of Athkatla. He was but a sprout of greatness. Tiax stole from a Shadow Thief Taskmaster, and Tiax's fearful father sent him out with a wandering heretic who worshipped Baervan Wildwanderer. Cyric's hand led Tiax to twist his ankle during a bandit's raid and be captured by the brigands. It was as a sacrifice that Tiax first faced Cyric. But he had no fear, not at all - Great Tiax would not soil himself in front of some lowlife bandits. Tiax went up to the altar and placed his head down on the block. But the servant of Cyric who was to cut his throat saw that Tiax was the Chosen one, and stepped back.~
@2505 = ~"This one lives. He's got spirit! The Prince of Lies has need of servants such as you, gnome! Find another slave to sacrifice; this one is now mine."~
@2506 = ~And it is from him that Tiax learned of Cyric and of his grand fate. Now, hmm... Tiax sees fit to bless you as a Keeper of Tiax's mighty slippers! Eight hundred slippers - and all under your command, slave. Tiax is benevolent today.~

@2563 = ~[XAN 33] I hope what you say was well intentioned.~ [%tutu_var%XANNN33]
@2564 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale.~ [DUMMYSND]

@2571 = ~Do I? *Xan appears to look nonchalant. But the quiet sadness in his eyes, never leaving yours, tells you all the answer you need.*~
@2572 = ~I have nobody else to care about, <CHARNAME>. Most of my family are now dead; those who still live are either upon Evermeet, far beyond my reach, or left behind in Evereska, under the questionable safety of her walls. It is my heart's greatest desire that you were somewhere safe, as well.~
@2573 = ~*Xan gives you a formal bow.* I suppose I may give you a full account of these reasons... but then we shall be severely delayed, I fear.~
@2574 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you quite sure that you are not a priestess of Sune, or a follower of her ways?~
@2575 = ~*Xan absently leans against you, nearly causing you to fall. Noticing his mistake, he sharply turns around and looks at you with utmost horror.* Do forgive me, <CHARNAME>. These days, I am not myself.~
@2576 = ~*Xan slowly turns around, placing himself in your arms, and brushes a stray lock of hair from your face.* Why are you so intent on chasing me? *sigh* Though I admit, I may as well ask myself the same question.~
@2577 = ~*In a flash, Xan draws a Moonblade out of its sheath and whips around, his sword at the ready. As he sees it is you, his right arm falls to one side helplessly, his mouth half-open.* <CHARNAME>, you scared me senseless. Whatever happens, do not do this again.~
@2578 = ~<CHARNAME>... *The gentleness with which Xan whispers your name is surprising. His hold is quite firm and while you are standing a foot apart, you feel the heat radiating from his skin. As Xan finally lets you out from his arms, his fingers brush your cheek, burning it, and his eyes seem to singe your face.*~
@2579 = ~*His embrace is warm, and it is strangely familiar to feel another elven body, so slight and alike your own, against yours. As Xan presses you more tightly, stroking your shoulders and whispering comforting words in your ear, you sense a new emotion - the call of your elven blood, of the heritage that has lain hidden for so long. Its pull is exhilarating and troubling at the same time, for you were raised by a human and among humans, and yet is somehow comforting. As you slip from under Xan's palms, you cannot help but feel you have just paid a short visit to the mysterious home of your own people, whose blood flows freely in your veins - the Tel'Quessir.*~
@2580 = ~*You feel him shivering in your arms, and as you raise your head, you are startled by how grim, forlorn and feverish his face looks. Xan sighs as he notices your gaze.* I do not want to lose you. Not now, not in the nearest future, not ever. Like a child, I am clinging to a desperate hope. It seems that I shall never learn, <CHARNAME>.~
@2581 = ~*Xan is poring over his spellbook, and he frowns as he looks up.* <CHARNAME>, I am sorry, but I have a spell to prepare. If you will excuse me...~
@2582 = ~*You give Xan a light peck on the cheek. He looks surprised, but says nothing. As you walk away, however, you hear a clearly audible sigh.*~
@2583 = ~May I ask you not to attempt it in the future? I am not set of stone, <CHARNAME>, though sometimes I wish I was.~
@2584 = ~I would be more careful if I were you - your human friend, Ajantis, casts dark glances in your direction even now. It is best if you make your choices fast, <CHARNAME>.~
@2585 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you by any chance confused me with Coran? *Xan winces heavily as he turns away.*~
@2586 = ~Do you seek company? I doubt mine is what you need at the moment; to tell you the truth, I see no point in conversation now.~
@2587 = ~*As you walk up to him, Xan's face lights up considerably, and he continues his pace very close by your side.*~
@2588 = ~*Xan becomes entangled in his robes once again, and you have to wait until he frees himself. As he does, Xan raises his head, looking halfway between wary and angry, as if he is afraid you have approached him to have a laugh. Then his gaze falls at you, and he seems to bite whatever retort he was holding. Instead, he nods to you silently, and gestures for you to move on.*~
@2589 = ~*You continue walking side by side, so your arms almost meet. You notice that Xan's fingers are twisting strangely, caressing air, as if he wanted to take your hand. Next moment, however, he takes a wide, purposeful step to one side, and proceeds from there without looking at you.* ~
@2590 = ~Would you... sing for me? I would dearly love to hear something fair among the bustle of the crowds and the dying monsters' howls. If you are willing, of course.~
@2591 = ~You have undoubtedly learned a lot at Candlekeep. Would you share you spellbook with me? I do not expect you to have the spells beyond your and mine ability to cast, but still, there might be something there to sate my curiosity, and, if you insist - to raise my spirits.~
@2592 = ~Oh, yes, there is. If you were a little more discreet about "stamping out Evil", "protecting the righteous" and "defending the innocent", you would have pleased me immensely.~
@2593 = ~*His palm is cold and lifeless, like this of a dying person. Noticing your reaction, Xan smiles ironically.* As I am as good as dead already, there is no need to pretend otherwise.~
@2594 = ~*With a slight shudder, he wrenches his hand out of your grasp.* Or, perhaps, I am just cold and am imagining things. Though that does not lessen the fact that we are to die very soon.~
@2595 = ~*He takes your hand in both of his, examining it.* Have you heard of this old superstition? Every man on Faerun has his fate written on his palms. Your likes and dislikes, your worries, your future, the date of your death...~
@2596 = ~*Xan drops your hand suddenly.* No. I do not want to know.~
@2597 = ~*Xan stares at your hand in fascination, apparently having forgotten about everything and everybody else. For a few moments, he stands very still. Then he takes the proffered arm with a sigh and you move on, your palm enfolded securely in his.*~
@2598 = ~*Xan brings your hand to his lips and quickly kisses the tips of your fingers.* I am ever at your service, my lady <CHARNAME>. But wait... this phrase is a trite and trivial thing one of these ever-seeing Helmites would say.~
@2599 = ~Watch your tongue, elf!~
@2600 = ~My sincere apologies, <CHARNAME>; I do not know what came over me. Alas, your company and your influence are not entirely benevolent.~
@2601 = ~*Xan arches an eyebrow.* What are you smiling about, <CHARNAME>? Our inevitable death, perhaps?~
@2602 = ~I admit, I am at a loss as to what caused this amusement. I would have thought our recent miseries have caused a change in your outlook, have they not?~
@2603 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, your smile is a beautiful sight. Is it what you wanted me to say?~
@2604 = ~*smiles sadly* What I wouldn't have given to see you do it more often...~
@2605 = ~I'll survive, I suppose. That is, if I do not fall on the battlefield today, which, I admit, is highly unlikely. ~
@2606 = ~*Xan throws a sharp look at your features and immediately takes your palm.* I should be more worried about you. Your foster father is dead, your very home is forbidden, enemies waste no time in attacking you - I can only hope you will survive this. *sigh* Though all hope is pointless when one thinks of death, inevitable and unyielding.~
@2607 = ~Why, I live, and I... *Xan suddenly flushes.* Never mind.~
@2608 = ~Life is so hollow... I do not think I have any strength to go on. Or desire, for that matter.~
@2609 = ~*Xan raises an eyebrow.* And so we are, <CHARNAME>. But I see that you wish for a more... quiet sort of friendship. Very well, I'll not bother you further.~
@2610 = ~*sigh* Trust me, <CHARNAME>, you do not want to know the answer.~
@2611 = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. Sometimes, I would like to pretend these questions do not exist at all. ~
@2612 = ~*Xan shakes his head negatively.* We are doomed, <CHARNAME>. Both of us are, and that says it all.~
@2613 = ~All three, I suppose. I would say there is something else, but it evades definition. *sigh* And perhaps it is for the best.~
@2614 = ~Is it so easy to notice? Ah, but of course: I distract you much more often than I should. *sigh* There is no answer to your question, <CHARNAME>. One does not need a reason to care about another person - they simply do. *Xan gives you a small, sad smile, leans forward and kisses your cheek.*~
@2615 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you need logic and reason behind every movement of the soul? If there were, I'd be running away even now. I see no logic in staying with you, in dreading your death every moment - only blind folly. *sigh* Though they say there is no folly like the folly of... care.~
@2616 = ~Why? I... I could try and remember how it started, I suppose. When I first met you, <CHARNAME>, I thought I came face to face with my past. Before the Moonblade was thrust into my hands, I, too, was unhindered by any troubles and fears, free of my duty and obligations, not yet scarred by endless missions, negotiations, treachery and other faults of the humankind... But these times are long gone, and now I can only see their reflections in your eyes. In a way, you are my home away from home - a beautiful reminder of what might have been...~
@2617 = ~*Xan stops abruptly, and his lips twist themselves into ironical smile.* You have a most peculiar trait, <CHARNAME>: when you ask a question of me, I cannot stop until my voice is hoarse. That alone is answer enough, don't you think?~
@2618 = ~<CHARNAME>, you ask a question that has agitated the minds of thousands, and yet is left unanswered. That is- ~
@2619 = ~*To your delight, Xan flushes crimson and chokes in mid-word. It takes him nearly a minute to overcome a sudden coughing fit, and once he is able to speak again, he absolutely refuses to resume the conversation. Still, the prospect of teasing him about a thousand maidens, eager for his care, looks appealing...*~
@2620 = ~*He deftly catches your palms and turns around, nearly throwing you off balance.* <CHARNAME>, your ambushes are certainly more pleasant than those of goblins and orcs, but one of these days, you will scare me to death. Not that anyone would mourn my passing, but I would still like to avoid it, if at all possible.~
@2621 = ~*You take him by surprise, and for a moment, it seems you are both going to fall. Then Xan slowly regains his composure and reaches for your hands, taking them in his. He plants a quick kiss on your palm and walks away without saying a word.*~
@2622 = ~*As your hands wrap around his waist and your chin touches his shoulder, Xan's breathing stops altogether.* That was rather sudden of you, <CHARNAME>. Somehow, I suspect you were not checking on my spell components, were you? *sigh* But this better be left unknown.~
@2623 = ~*Startled, Xan trips over the hem of his robes as he makes the next step, and the next moment both of you are on the ground, your arms still around him. As he tries to disentangle himself from the robes, you come face to face, so close that a soft wave of his brown hair touches your cheek, and his lips brush the tip of your nose. His breath and heartbeat mingling with yours, you say nothing for almost a minute. Finally, as both of you rise from the ground, his cheeks are flaming red, and he deliberately avoids your gaze.*~
@2624 = ~*Xan's palms rest on your shoulders lightly.* I wish I could grant you true safety, <CHARNAME>, not this illusion, brief and fleeting. But if this small comfort makes you feel better, you are welcome to ask for it whenever you want. *sigh* Provided I am alive at the time, of course.~
@2625 = ~*Xan absently returns your brief embrace, then freezes as his eyes meet yours. You do not know what he sees there, but for once, his gloomy expression seems ready to crumble. Both of you stand still for a long moment, then he reluctantly lets go.* ~
@2626 = ~*Xan stiffens, caught by your unexpected demand, but as you rest your head on his shoulder, his arms wrap around you, slowly and almost reverently. His warm breath fills your hair, his fingers gently stroke your arm, and as you look upward, you see an uncharacteristically content expression in his eyes. For the next few minutes, his foes and miseries are forgotten.*~
@2627 = ~*The air is chilly, and as you approach him, your body gives an involuntary shiver. In a single fluid movement, Xan unfastens his cloak and throws it over the pair of you, drawing you close. As you nestle against him, his arms slip under the garment and settle around your waist. The embrace feels too intimate, but you are so comfortable and warm that you choose to ignore the fact.*~
@2628 = ~*He does not, however, and after a few seconds, Xan awkwardly emerges from under the cloak and walks away, leaving it tightly wrapped around your shoulders.*~
@2629 = ~*As you approach Xan with a glint in your eye, his gaze returns to the road, and your lips only get to brush his cheek. He turns his head in surprise, his eyes scanning your face as intently as they were studying the horizon moments before. Then the uncomfortable moment passes, and he returns the caress, his features softening as his lips move across your forehead.*~
@2630 = ~*For the next few hours, Xan definitely looks less mournful than is normal for him.*~
@2631 = ~*You engage in a short, soft kiss, and after a few seconds, your lips part. Xan sighs, his face a mixture of longing and exasperation.* <CHARNAME>, are you determined to make my death as bitter as possible? If so, you are performing admirably. I realise it is futile even to ask, but I shall: stop tormenting me. I have ceased to discern reality from a waking dream as it is.~
@2632 = ~*Xan pulls back before you can even touch him.* <CHARNAME>, I appreciate your sense of humor, but there is a line between joking and cruelty. Do not cross it. ~
@2633 = ~*Your lips lock with his, and for a moment, Xan's eyes widen in shock. Then he starts to respond, and what may have been a brief kiss soon becomes a hot, ardent dance of skin against skin, as sensations overwhelm you. You are not aware of how you have found your way into his arms, or when exactly he has pulled you close, but now your whole being is melting into his, and the outside world ceases to exist. There is nothing but the soft fabric of his robes under your palms, his hands, running along your spine, and his lips, drinking hungrily of yours.* ~
@2634 = ~*A shudder passes through Xan's body, and he steps back, breaking the embrace. His hands momentarily rest upon your shoulders, both steadying you and preventing you from approaching; then he lets his arms fall. As you glance around, you see that your brief escapade remained unnoticed, but a single look at Xan's face - breathless, shaken and lost - tells you the worst is far from over.*~
@2635 = ~*He motions you to sit down next to him, and starts to speak, slowly and deliberately, choosing every word with great care.* <CHARNAME>, this has not happened. You were playing a joke, and I could not resist the temptation. I will carry the memory to my grave, but it must never again come to be in the waking world. I will not survive your death, then, and I do not want you to be hurt by mine. ~
@2636 = ~*Xan presses a finger to your lips, kisses your cheek and walks away. As your gaze follows him, you see that his shoulders are slumped loosely forward, like those of a drunken man, and his gait is unsteady.* ~
@2637 = ~*You silently approach Xan, your strides falling into step with his. He continues walking as if he has not noticed, but as you move on, you see he is studying the incessant rhythm of your feet, and judging by the way his face relaxes, he finds the sight to his liking.*~
@2638 = ~*Xan gives you a quizzical look, but seeing you have nothing else in mind, he turns his gaze back on the road. However, you notice that he, too, slightly alters the direction of his steps, until you walk shoulder to shoulder.*~
@2639 = ~*As you come closer, his arm wraps around your shoulders, quickly and quietly. It feels nice, if unexpected, but the next moment he jerks it back with a wry smile, mutters a brief apology and retreats to the back of the group.*~
@2640 = ~*Xan is too immersed in his own thoughts to notice. Eventually he lags behind, and you are walking alone again.*~
@2641 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am flattered, but there is no need for you to exert yourself.~
@2642 = ~*sigh* Have you suddenly become able to kill every monster on Faerun, erect an impenetrable wall around Evereska, and stay alive for at least a few centuries?~
@2643 = ~*As you think how to react to this unusual compliment, Xan steps up to you, taking your hand in his, and speaks, very quietly* Yes, <CHARNAME>, I want you to live. Today, tomorrow, the next year, the next century - I want you to go on, instead of perishing in yet another skirmish. But that is too much to wish for, isn't it? ~
@2644 = ~The whole idea is pointless, <CHARNAME>. What is a moment of joy, compared to the horrors that await us ahead? *Xan sighs heavily, and turns away.* ~
@2645 = ~Ask Ajantis to smite evil elsewhere, <CHARNAME>. His black and white views are not only depressing - they are grinding on my nerves. *Xan's hands start twitching nervously, and you can guess he has more than one reason to dislike Ajantis.*~
@2646 = ~<CHARNAME>, you will have my eternal gratitude, if you dispose of a certain bard. Preferably in a painful way, but I do not ask for much. Requesting Eldoth to seek his fortune in Icewind Dale would do, I suppose.~
@2647 = ~*His long, slender fingers idly trace lines on your palm. Once, twice, again and again. Finally, you realise he is scribing the same set of patterns - your name. Xan has probably noticed your reaction, for he squeezes your hand and looks at you seriously.* ~
@2648 = ~You were looking troubled, <CHARNAME>. Whether you were thinking of Gorion or your latest nightmare, you needed words of consolation. And which words are suited better than your own name?~
@2649 = ~<CHARNAME>, I hate to remind you of this, but in a few moments, we shall undoubtedly have another battle on our... hands. *Xan gently disentangles his hand.* ~
@2650 = ~*Xan's grasp is delicate and tender, and would have been enjoyable if his arm was not trembling so badly. He tries to steady it, but to no avail. With a sigh, he lets go.* I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Your hand feels so warm and real... I cannot bear to think that in a few days it may be such no longer. ~
@2651 = ~*Without a word, Xan takes your hand, and you walk in comfortable silence.* ~
@2652 = ~*The corners of Xan's mouth quirk up in return, but then he shakes his head.* I have nothing to smile about, <CHARNAME>. ~
@2653 = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME>, there are enemies and dangers all around us, and yet you persist in treating our journey as a leisurely walk. You will smile even on a deathbed, it seems.~
@2654 = ~*As he turns away, you catch an almost inaudible whisper: "And death itself will hesitate and falter".* ~
@2655 = ~*Xan gives you a reluctant smile in return. It looks more like a grimace, but is strangely becoming just the same.* ~
@2656 = ~*A dreamy expression on Xan's face clearly states he is enjoying the view, but then he flinches, and the emotion disappears under his habitual mask of sour melancholy.* Your smile reminded me of home, <CHARNAME>. If only beauty was not so fleeting and death so inevitable... *sigh* Never mind; I am rambling once again.~
@2657 = ~Thriving, <CHARNAME>. As you can probably guess, slimy dungeons, drunkard's havens and bandit encampments have always thrilled me to no end.~
@2658 = ~Well enough, <CHARNAME>. After Mulahey's treatment, any sort of existence is a benevolent one. I cannot say I enjoy our travels, but your company makes me oblivious to the many hardships we endure.~
@2659 = ~Me? I am alive, for now, as you can well see. Though I suspect that you have released me from Mulahey's prison only for some other appalling fate.~
@2660 = ~What do you wish to hear, <CHARNAME>? I have no desire to lull you down the path of false security. It is very probable both of us will die before the day is out. *sigh* Whatever I answer, soon it will become unimportant.~
@2661 = ~*Xan shakes his head at your approach, looking tired and listless, and you have no choice but to indeed leave him alone.*~ [X#BLANK]
@2662 = ~*Xan, your soulmate, lover and comrade in arms, walks at your side. His expression is far from serene, but a change for the better is clearly evident.*~ [X#BLANK]
@2663 = ~Xan, will you smile for me?~
@2664 = ~*Embrace Xan*~
@2665 = ~Is something troubling you?~
@2666 = ~Xan, you are a wonderful, wonderful person. Never change.~
@2667 = ~Much has changed since our first meeting in Nashkel mines, don't you think?~
@2668 = ~*Sigh mournfully*~
@2669 = ~*Massage Xan's shoulders soothingly*~
@2670 = ~*Ask Xan for a shoulder message*~
@2671 = ~*Stretch in front of Xan, providing him with a fine view*~
@2672 = ~*Run your fingers through Xan's hair*~
@2673 = ~Xan, I love you.~
@2674 = ~*Xan lifts you off your feet and spins you around, his normal gloominess lost in a blink. He lets out a very happy sigh as he puts you down.* And so do I, melamin.~
@2675 = ~*Instead of answering, Xan takes your face in his hands and kisses you. Slowly, tentatively at first, but soon it gets out of hand, nearly overthrowing you with intensity and passion as your arms wrap around each other, your hair mingles in the wind, and the world reels before your eyes.*~
@2676 = ~*When you break up, his voice rustles into your heated face* Amin mela lle, Estel'amin. While I breathe, I love.~
@2677 = ~I cannot help the feeling as well, <CHARNAME>... and neither do I want to suppress it.~
@2678 = ~I did not want to tell you this. What was the point of uttering these words, I thought, when all it could do was to give you a worse torment in the end? But... I do love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2679 = ~*Quick as if he is in anticipating your desires, Xan catches your hand in the air and kisses it, instead.*~
@2680 = ~*Xan jerks his head irritably.* <CHARNAME>, my hair does not deserve the horrible treatment you gave it last time. Leave it in peace, at least for today.~
@2681 = ~*You pick a strand of his hair and start twisting it with your fingers into the semblance of a braid. After repeating the process for the twentieth time, Xan's hairdo starts to remind you of the multitude of small brown snakes. You hope that he won't see himself in the mirror anytime soon.* ~
@2682 = ~*Xan closes his eyes gratefully, enjoying the caress.*~
@2683 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do not doubt you are beautiful. But is this the proper time?~
@2684 = ~*Xan raises eyebrows and shakes his head.*~
@2685 = ~*He sighs and mutters something suspiciously like 'insufferable' under his breath.*~
@2686 = ~*Ignoring Coran's approving whistle, Xan turns and walks away, his shoulders slumped and the tips of his pointy ears flaming. Obviously, he mistook Coran for the object of your attentions.*~
@2687 = ~*His palms run lightly up your forearms, coming to a halt on your shoulders. Then his left hand starts kneading the base of your neck, while the right hand's fingers continue walking up and down your spine. Both of his hands move very slowly, as slowly as he was going to devote all the time in the world to you. After several minutes, however, Xan kisses your neck and quietly withdraws.*~
@2688 = ~*Xan slides his hands up and over your collarbone and presses, very gently. His movements become slower and slower, until you begin to suspect something is going wrong.*~
@2689 = ~*You turn around, and see that his skin is nearly grey with exhaustion, deep shadows circle his eyes, and his head drops onto his shoulder; he is fast asleep.* ~
@2690 = ~Not now, <CHARNAME>: it is not wise to linger. I will gladly do it tonight, if you want me to. And if we are alive at the time, which I doubt, given the risks we take.~
@2691 = ~*Deep in his thoughts, Xan does not hear your question.*~
@2692 = ~*You start softly, progressively massaging deeper, working on large, commonly sore areas of muscle. There is indeed a small amount of muscle there - probably fencing and the wielding of the Moonblade has taken its effect.* *After a minute of you stroking his soft, cool skin, Xan takes a deep breath and covers your palms with his, easily drawing you to the front. For nearly a minute, you rest yourself against him, calm and safe.* ~
@2693 = ~*For all you know, these hands and shoulders could belong to a woman, so soft and delicate they are. You are not fooled, however: you remember the ease with which he helped you lift the heavier loot, or indeed, raised you in the air.*~
@2694 = ~*As you stroke his arms, Xan's breathing becomes calmer, and he slowly falls asleep, swaying gently under your palms. You are forced to shake him awake to proceed.* ~
@2695 = ~*You work your way down from the back of his neck to his shoulders, but as soon as you lay your hands there, Xan abruptly turns to you, squeezing your palms.* My thanks, <CHARNAME>, but we have to move on.~
@2696 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot thank you enough for your offer, but I am unable to appreciate it fully. Not with our current situation, I am afraid.~
@2697 = ~*Xan absently sighs in return, looking, if possible, more subdued then ever.*~
@2698 = ~*sigh* It must be my bad influence, I suppose. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@2699 = ~<CHARNAME>, everything will... *sigh* Let us just go.~
@2700 = ~*sigh* So, it dawned on you, too, that life is hollow and pointless.~
@2701 = ~Perhaps, but we are still due to die any moment now.~
@2702 = ~*smiles sadly* Your company is indeed better than Mulahey's, <CHARNAME>, I give you that.~
@2703 = ~More and more of your enemies perish under our feet, that's true. You have become an unstoppable force... except that there are no invincible powers in this world.~
@2704 = ~Yes... and I admit, I was a fool not to recognize my feelings towards you for what they were. Melamin, meeting you was the most amazing experience in my life. I only wish it had happened earlier.~
@2705 = ~Why would you resort to flattery, I wonder?~
@2706 = ~That's quite an interesting problem you pose. Should I stay unchanged, or should your perception of me remain so? These are two different things, <CHARNAME>. Do think on it.~
@2707 = ~I, too, would like to preserve you, the way I see you at the moment. Young, beautiful, free... but alas, these qualities invariably succumb to age, suffering and despair.~
@2708 = ~The change is inevitable. You know it as well as I do, <CHARNAME>.~
@2709 = ~I have been thinking on our future - if indeed we have any. But there is only death there, yours or mine. Death, and darkness.~
@2710 = ~There is something, yes. <CHARNAME>, have you considered how many people guard the headquarters of the Iron Throne, the organization that is behind this entire turmoil? We shall have to confront them sooner or later, and, with our pitiful resources, we can do nothing but die.~
@2711 = ~I... I received ill tidings from Evereska, not long before I was captured, and now I am musing over the danger that threatens her. It is probable that it will be besieged, and eventually taken. Many will die, and if I am alive at the moment, I shall be doomed to become a man without a home, a vagabond in the eyes of my kin - not unlike you are now.~
@2712 = ~*sigh* But it was harsh of me to remind you of Gorion and Candlekeep yet again. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>; let us move on, lest we are ambushed even here.~
@2713 = ~You, <CHARNAME>, you and me. What else could captivate my thoughts?~
@2714 = ~*Xan neither sighs no protests when you find your way into his embrace, but he is still tense, and he lets his arms fall much earlier than you would have expected.*~
@2715 = ~*Instead of taking you into his arms, Xan gives your face a single look and sweeps you off your feet, leaving your backpack on the ground. Completely oblivious to the startled looks of your companions, he rocks you in his arms slightly, like he would a child, and does not seem to think about your impending doom at all.*~
@2716 = ~My beautiful <CHARNAME>... *Xan sighs and buries his face in your hair.*~
@2717 = ~*Xan holds you in a clinch for a few seconds, then places a quick kiss on your cheek and releases you, already muttering an incantation for a battle to come.*~
@2718 = ~*As you bring your lips to his, Xan looks at you disbelievingly for a few moments, then closes his eyes, his lips trembling almost as violently as his fingers in your hair. As you part, a strange, sweet and bitter taste lingers in your mouth.*~
@2719 = ~*You brush your lips against his, and their warmth starts to flood through you. Xan responds hesitantly at first, his eyes still on your surroundings, then his lips start to search yours more and more hungrily, until you hear a soft moan, though, lost in the kiss, you are unsure who produced it.* ~
@2720 = ~*His kisses wander from your mouth all over your face, travelling against your skin with agonizing slowness, burning on your neckline with such intensity that your heart starts to hammer. But then you shift slightly, and the moment is gone; Xan steps back, looking rather guilty.*~
@2721 = ~I do believe that we set out adventuring, not... else. Didn't we, <CHARNAME>? *sigh* Though now I am not so sure...~
@2722 = ~*Xan presses you very tightly against him, your body practically becoming one with his. As you lace your hands around his neck, he lowers his face to yours, his own still dark and serious.* ~
@2723 = ~*After a series of the short, soft, questing kisses, however, his expression changes entirely. You blink, opening your eyes, and see the face that could belong to your peer, if not your junior - so relaxed and vulnerable it looks. Xan sighs and shifts against you slightly, seemingly unwilling to let go.*~
@2724 = ~*Time is pressing, however, and soon you break apart - to move on.*~
@2725 = ~*The scent of his hair, the taste of his lips, the soft feel of his hands at your waist - the multitude of sensations assaults you and keeps swirling in your mind long after the kiss is over, causing your head to spin at dizzying speed.* ~
@2726 = ~*Judging by the dreamy look of him, Xan does not think of the road, either.*~
@2727 = ~*sigh* Should I sing and dance, as well? You cannot change one's nature, <CHARNAME>.~
@2728 = ~*Xan smiles, slowly and cautiously, as if expecting something wicked to happen. In a moment, however, the smile is gone, and he is looking gloomy and distant again.*~
@2729 = ~*Instead of honoring your request, Xan leans forward and kisses your brow.* I will, melamin. But there are things weighing heavily on my mind, still.~
@2730 = ~Why would you wish it, <CHARNAME>? I cannot change my demeanor against my will.~
@2731 = ~*Xan stares at you for a long moment, disbelief firmly etched on his face. Then he manages a smile.* It... takes time to get used to it, Estel'amin.~
@2732 = ~Estel'amin... thank you.~
@2733 = ~*A spontaneous and tender kiss answers you without any words.*~
@2734 = ~I thought it was futile to attempt to avoid death, but these words... your words... makes it all worthwhile.~
@2735 = ~*His normally beautiful hair is matted, and jumps around his face in haphazard curls. Your hand quickly gets lost in the tangles.*~
@2736 = ~*Xan stops, allowing you to play with his soft, silky tresses, and regards you with a small smile.* I never suspected my hair was more important than our tasks and enemies. *sigh* I wish I had your view of things.~
@2737 = ~*His long, brown hair slides along your fingers with ease, so light that they seem weightless. It is hard to turn into a complete mess, but eventually, you leave no trace of the quaint, luxuriant strands. Instead, what piles on the top of Xan's head closely resembles a raven's nest.*~
@2738 = ~*Xan sourly stares at his reflection in the nearest puddle.* My thanks and great appreciation, <CHARNAME>. I always suspected that the list of my miseries was not complete.~
@2739 = ~*Xan frowns and extends his hand, preventing you from approaching.* I feel danger, <CHARNAME>. Whatever you have in mind must wait, I fear.~
@2740 = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME>, you are a beautiful, insufferable, teasing and completely reckless child. I do not doubt the local brigands would be delighted at such a display, had they a chance to witness it.~
@2741 = ~*Xan sweeps you in his arms, throwing a cold glance around.* I, however, caution you against it.~
@2742 = ~*Xan is watching... unwilling, perhaps, but watching just the same. Definitely.* ~
@2743 = ~*Xan's dark, slanted eyes widen in disbelief.* <CHARNAME>, what came over you?~
@2744 = ~*Xan tries to speak, but his breath seems to have caught in his throat, and instead, he simply looks at you with fond, admiring eyes. Then his face darkens, and he abruptly turns away.*~
@2745 = ~*His strokes are soft and flowing, the flats of his hands caressing, slithering, and sliding all over your neck and shoulders in a very tender way. Then the pressure upon your skin increases, as Xan kneads your tired muscles with his quick and fluid fingers, setting your skin on fire. He continues to alter his movements, until revitalizing and relaxing strokes blend and merge in a harmonious way, as if he was playing a beautiful symphony on your skin. Your body is a grateful listener, and you experience several minutes of absolute bliss, before his palms slowly and reluctantly leave your skin.* ~
@2746 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would love to, but your presence is too intoxicating. I would not be able to concentrate on my magic afterwards. *Xan gives your shoulders a longing look, and you can tell it cost him a lot to say this.*~
@2747 = ~*He glides his hands over your neck in opposite directions, one stroking up toward the neck and over the head, and the other moving down toward the base. Both of his hands rest quietly over these areas. Then Xan takes a small step forward and brings his lips to the back of your head.*~
@2748 = ~Estel'amin... do not abandon me. Do not turn to ashes, do not fall into darkness. However dismal and hollow this world is, I do not want you to leave it. *sigh* Not that my wishes ever mattered.~
@2749 = ~*Xan gives your surroundings a skeptical look, but proceeds at your request without a sigh of displeasure. For a short while, his long, slender fingers work on your muscles, varying the pressure, so that it is firmer as they move apart, and softer as they glide back toward each other. Then he takes your hand and motions you to move on.* ~
@2750 = ~*Xan gently takes your hand off his shoulder and kisses it.* <CHARNAME>, I appreciate your attempt, but... not here. *sigh* The death in your arms is not the worst that may happen to a man, but it is a death, regardless.~
@2751 = ~*Xan slides from under your hands and shakes his head tiredly.* Estel'amin, I fear I am doomed to collapse with exhaustion, and soon. Your efforts will be wasted, if you do not call a halt.~
@2752 = ~*You bring your hands to the base of his neck, and his shoulders relax, slouching slightly. His skin is soft and warm to the touch, and the scars left after Mulahey's tortures are now barely visible. He breathes lightly and evenly under your fingertips, apparently feeling at ease.*~
@2753 = ~*As you start working on his neck, Xan inclines his head, sighing softly, as a child would. The next moment, however, he sharply jerks his face up, as an odd sound emerges from the nearby bushes. It proves to be a false alarm, but the moment is lost, and with a brief kiss, he leaves your side.* ~
@2754 = ~*Xan's build is lithe and lean, but fragile, almost skinny, and for a moment, you cannot help feeling that your touch will break him in two. He is also slightly taller than you, and you have to raise your head to fully see the object of your work. A mass of his hair partly obscures the view, as well as the high collar of his cloak, and it takes some time to get these obstacles safely out of the way.*~
@2755 = ~*Soon, however, you are able to proceed with your task. From the moment your fingertips come to rest on his shoulders, he stands absolutely still, neither moving nor breathing, and the only result you feel is the increasing heat of his skin.*~
@2756 = ~*When you are finished, Xan turns around and traces a line along your face, very gently.* You are a miracle, <CHARNAME>. I have forgotten all about our... what was it? Misfortunes? ~
@2757 = ~*He gives you a sad, knowing smile.* But that does not get them out of our way, I am afraid. *sigh* Come, let us face them, as we probably should.~
@2758 = ~*Xan raises an eyebrow suspiciously, but says nothing.* ~
@2759 = ~<CHARNAME>? Are you all right?~
@2760 = ~Fine. I just felt like... sighing.~
@2761 = ~How can I be "all right", Xan? After everything that has happened?~
@2762 = ~Ah, I see. I shall leave you to your... sighing, then.~
@2763 = ~*Xan cradles you in his arms.* I am sorry not to be of more help, Estel'amin.~
@2764 = ~*Xan produces a long, masterful sigh in return, and tilts his head, regarding you with some amusement.* <CHARNAME>, it would do you no good. Stay yourself, not a younger version of me.~
@2765 = ~*Xan gives you a worried look and steps up to you, putting a comforting arm around your shoulders.* Estel'amin, how I wish to tell you that it will be all right...~
@2766 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. *sigh* Much has changed indeed.~
@2767 = ~To the point of impossible, <CHARNAME>.~
@2768 = ~I cannot call the circumstances of our first meeting pleasant, but the subsequent events... *Xan leans in and finishes the thought with a slow, long and tender kiss.*~
@2769 = ~*Xan looks at you wistfully.* It did, and I fear that next changes will not be for the better.~
@2770 = ~<CHARNAME>, even if I wanted to, I could not. We have very little time left for changes. *sigh* We are all doomed, you know.~
@2771 = ~*However, a small smile, hiding in the corner of his eyes, shows that he appreciates the thought.* ~
@2772 = ~*Xan's face contorts into a bitter grimace.* Why would you say such a thing? <CHARNAME>, I do not have the heart to follow my duty, I can do nothing to defend you or my home - I am only a feeble mockery of what a Moonblade wielder should be.~
@2773 = ~No, Estel'amin. You are. I will never be able to thank you enough for sharing your heart with me.~
@2774 = ~*sigh* There are still things I would like to change. Your terrible destiny, and mine - these are far from wonderful.~
@2775 = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME>, if I started to list my troubles, we would not be able to move on until next morning.~
@2776 = ~*Xan raises his head, and you see that his face is full of despair once again.* Hopeless, <CHARNAME>. It is all hopeless. We shall not survive. We would never make it to the end of your quest. I... *sigh* Please, leave me be for a while.~
@2777 = ~*He looks at you in some surprise.* It did... but now you have asked me, I do not remember what it was.~
@2778 = ~*Xan looks at you seriously.* I will manage, <CHARNAME>. My woes are nothing, compared to yours.~
@2779 = ~*He sighs as you step into his arms.* <CHARNAME>... I still cannot believe it is happening. I wish I would, before it is too late, and you are... no longer here. ~
@2780 = ~*Xan interrupts himself and brings you closer, grasping your shoulder blades so tightly it hurts.* No. Not if I can help it.~
@2781 = ~*You place your head on Xan's chest and rub your cheek against his robes, which rustle softly under your touch. His hands gently slide up and down your arms, before settling around your waist, and as they do, his lips find your ear and start whispering some soft, tender nonsense. For a moment, you feel warm, contented and fully relaxed.*~
@2782 = ~*Xan wraps an arm around your shoulders, the other one entwined in your hair.* Estel'amin, you have granted me a beautiful moment. A perfect moment. But it is not to last, is it?~
@2783 = ~*He kisses your forehead and lets you out of his arms with a heavy sigh.*~
@2784 = ~*Your sudden assault catches him off guard. Xan stumbles and falls flat on his back, dragging you down with him.*~
@2785 = ~*When he finally catches his breath, your lover gives you an ironical smile.* <CHARNAME>, with you as my companion, who needs enemies?~
@2786 = ~*His lips are soft and moist, but somewhat reluctant, and he finishes the kiss much earlier than you have expected.*~
@2787 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have just interrupted a spell I was about to cast. In a very enjoyable and unusual way, I admit, but please, be more... careful next time.~
@2788 = ~*You never know how it will turn out, and this time is no exception. Your lips meet in a casual, almost friendly gesture, but within moments you are not able to breathe, as the kiss becomes deeper, more sensual, and your arms and lips get lost in one another.*~
@2789 = ~*After you break apart, it takes you several minutes to catch your breath.*~
@2790 = ~*Xan returns your kiss, but his mind is elsewhere, and judging by a faint crease between his eyebrows, his thoughts are not pleasant ones.*~
@2791 = ~*You are obviously not the only one intent on the idea, for in the next moment, Xan turns to you, catching you in his arms, and covers your cheeks, your forehead and eyebrows with kisses, never touching your lips.*~
@2792 = ~*When he pulls back, his flushed cheeks, a slightly dazed look in his eyes and the way his hair dangles over the face suggest that for a short while, he will not be able to concentrate on his magic at all.*~
@2793 = ~*For once, your lover treats you with a genuine smile - a rare sight indeed.*~
@2794 = ~Estel'amin, when this wretched day is over, and we have found a relatively safe place to rest, I will try. *sigh* But now is not the time and place for frivolities.~
@2795 = ~*A hesitant smile appears on his face, looking very much out of harmony with his gloomy, forlorn look. But it is a smile, nevertheless.*~
@2796 = ~*Xan gives you a faint, sad smile you know so well.* For you, Estel'amin... anything.~
@2797 = ~*Xan surveys the world melancholically and sighs. Perhaps a pleasant conversation will distract him from gloomy thoughts, and maybe you will learn something about him to boot.*~ [X#BLANK]
@2798 = ~*You decide that you cannot be bothered, lest you learn things you do not want to know about Xan.*~
@2799 = ~So, Xan, can you tell me more about yourself?~
@2800 = ~*You ask Xan lots of personal questions.*~
@2801 = ~*You proceed with asking inquisitive questions about Xan's past.* ~
@2802 = ~*You talk about Xan's problems and hopes, in a friendly and kind manner, in hopes of making Xan confide in you.*~
@2803 = ~*You are used to hearing things from the bottom of people's hearts... so you try to charm Xan into telling you more about himself.* ~
@2804 = ~Oh Prophet of Doom, I need thy wisdom! What do we do now?~
@2805 = ~Xan, I think that we are all going to die.~
@2806 = ~Once this business with the Iron Throne is over, will you travel with me?~
@2807 = ~Smile, Xan!~
@2808 = ~Does your equipment suit your taste and ability? Mayhap there is anything else we need to purchase?~
@2809 = ~Xan, I don't know what came over me. Would you accept my apology? I hate us being on such cold and distant terms.~
@2810 = ~<CHARNAME>... it will not lead to anything good, are you aware of that? But I cannot resist your plea: it is rather hard to remain indifferent to your imploring eyes. *sigh* You'll be the death of me yet.~
@2811 = ~But this is how it should be. I have always feared that being close to you was a mistake; you have only assertained my doubts. Do not feel guilty, <CHARNAME>: you have done wisely in showing me my proper place. Let us continue on our way and put this awkward conversation behind us. ~
@2812 = ~*Xan laughs bitterly.* Another Ring of Wizardry, a Staff of the Magi, and the Robe of Vecna, no less! No, it will not help me in the slightest. One who is doomed to die will perish regardless of these trinkets.~
@2813 = ~<CHARNAME>, if we do not rest now, any equipment will be useless in an hour's time. I shall collapse from exhaustion before you are able to buy a single scroll.~
@2814 = ~*Xan regards his spellbook with pursued lips.* Yes, <CHARNAME>, I am in dire need of some scrolls. I shall give you a full list... no. *sigh* They'll probably not have a tenth part of what I need, anyway. ~
@2815 = ~It does not suit me at all, but it is irrelevant. A day, a tenday, a month - and my gear will rot somewhere in the wilderness, and vultures will devour my corpse.~
@2816 = ~Thank you for your interest, <CHARNAME>, but I suggest you spend the coin on yourself: I am doomed, while you, perhaps, are not. Though your chances are slim indeed.~
@2817 = ~I am a Greycloak, <CHARNAME>. Discomfort and fatigue have always been my faithful companions. Buy whatever you will - it will not change.~
@2818 = ~Yes, I have run out of healing potions again, it seems. But do not bother to give me any; I have a premonition that some barbarian axe-wielder will chop my head off in the next battle.~
@2819 = ~What do you want to purchase? Another cursed claw? Or a potion that makes the drinker a gibbering idiot? No, thank you, <CHARNAME>. We have more than enough enemies without being threatened by our own belongings.~
@2820 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would gladly give up every piece of my equipment, if you would allow me to leave your company. *sigh* But you would not...~
@2821 = ~*Xan gives an indignant snort.*~
@2822 = ~*He raises an eyebrow.* Should I?~
@2823 = ~There is no point, <CHARNAME>.~
@2824 = ~Oh, very well... *Xan manages a forced smile, clearly irritated.*~
@2825 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop distracting me or our group will lie dead before the end of the day. ~
@2826 = ~*sigh*~
@2827 = ~*Xan rolls his eyes and makes a point of walking as far from you as possible.* ~
@2828 = ~*Xan mutters something inaudible, of which only the word "doom" is distinguishable, and turns away.*~
@2829 = ~*sigh* They say that children are the cruelest beings on Toril... ~
@2830 = ~Once it is over, I shall be lying in a lonely, shallow, unmarked grave. If your travels continue, it shall be without me.~
@2831 = ~But would you want to travel? Adventuring is far from exciting, <CHARNAME>; if anything, it is draining and depressing. *sigh* You have a perfect example right in front of you.~
@2832 = ~*Xan shakes his head.* I was made defender of Elvendom, not defender of <CHARNAME>. I am sorry, but once my task is over, so is our time together.~
@2833 = ~This is not what you wish to know. Ask yourself, instead: once it is over, will you be alive?~
@2834 = ~*Xan gives you a formal bow.* You have saved my life, and I am grateful to you. But I am a Moonblade wielder, and my first debt is to my people.~
@2835 = ~You would continue to travel in the company of a doomed man? I thought you were wiser than that, <CHARNAME>.~
@2836 = ~Were I free of other obligations, there would be no other answer I could give. *sigh* However, I am a Greycloak of Evereska, and thus I cannot stay in these lands. My first duty is to protect my home.~
@2837 = ~Time will tell, <CHARNAME>.~
@2838 = ~What for, <CHARNAME>? Does gloating at my misery bring you some perverted satisfaction? No, I shall return to Evereska, though I sincerely hope that I will be killed on my way there.~
@2839 = ~Always, Estel'amin. Till death do us part.~
@2840 = ~Why state the obvious, <CHARNAME>?~
@2841 = ~Yes, we are. I would add "soon", if you do not mind.~
@2842 = ~So, you have finally realised it. Congratulations, <CHARNAME>, though I doubt the knowledge will do you any good.~
@2843 = ~*sigh* To die, to cease to exist, to depart to another Plane... Sometimes I think all these are but legends, and the truth is plain and simple: there is no afterlife, and no hope. ~
@2844 = ~*Xan looks past you, his gaze strangely empty.* Life is suffering. Death is release. Let us save our effort and just lay down and die.~
@2845 = ~A lonely death after a tawdry life. Yes, <CHARNAME>, there is no more than that.~
@2846 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are too young to indulge in such thoughts.~
@2847 = ~Eventually, yes. I shall do my best to delay this moment for you, however.~
@2848 = ~*Xan's laughter is almost hysterical.* Indeed? What a fabulous revelation! I gladly welcome it!~
@2849 = ~Why do you ask, <CHARNAME>? There is but one goal in front of you: Sarevok.~
@2850 = ~*sigh* I would advise you to run from this folly, but I suspect you will not even listen.~
@2851 = ~If you do not kill Sarevok, he will eventually come for you. On the other hand, if you confront him, you will likely die, and so will I. *sigh* I do not know what to advise you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2852 = ~There is only one thing I can be sure of, now: we are all doomed.~
@2853 = ~*Xan swiftly crosses the distance between you and cradles your face in his palms, whispering hotly between kisses* Do... not... go. Run away from this... accursed city, somewhere... where no one... is aware... of your heritage. Away... from Sarevok. Away from your... destiny.~
@2854 = ~*Xan looks at you seriously.* Your dreams, <CHARNAME>. Your nightmares. Gorion must have known something about the mystery of your origin. Search his room, ask his former friends, but find it!~
@2855 = ~Sarevok is probably here, together with the leaders of the Iron Throne. Shall we search for them?~
@2856 = ~You mentioned Gorion to me more than once. I would like to see his... former... chambers. Perhaps it will bring you some peace of mind, as well.~
@2857 = ~What... what did you say? I was admiring your former home, and I lost track of things. *sigh* It looks so peaceful, so safe... but I have a feeling that we are in for an unpleasant surprise. Either the scenery will change, or people here will show their true intent, and I have a foreboding it is far from friendly.~
@2858 = ~<CHARNAME>, who am I to question Elminster's advice? Do as he says: search for Scar, and eventually, for Duke Eltan.~
@2859 = ~I miss Evereska so... How long do we have to endure our stay in Baldur's Gate, <CHARNAME>?~
@2860 = ~We must proceed carefully. No doubt brigands and assassins are abound, here. I suggest you study the map of the city, and choose a relatively safe place to stay. *sigh* Though, of course, there is none.~
@2861 = ~Scar mentioned helping him; perhaps we should pay him a visit?~
@2862 = ~I thought you had some urgent errand in the city of Baldur's Gate, did you not?~
@2863 = ~*mutters* Spiders, druids, miners, slaves... no, <CHARNAME>, leave me be. I am tired as it is.~
@2864 = ~*sigh* Let us clean these mines as soon as possible. Until the Iron Throne is destroyed, I am doomed to follow at your tail, and I cannot say I enjoy every moment of it.~
@2865 = ~It makes no difference where to perish. Cloakwood forest, Cloakwood caves, Cloakwood mines - we are doomed, regardless.~
@2866 = ~*shudder* I do not want to think about it; Nashkel mines were quite enough. <CHARNAME>, would you rather leave me in some burrow? Death by the claw of a wild beast is far preferable to what may await me in the depths.~
@2867 = ~Peldvale, or Larswood, <CHARNAME>. We should search in these places.~
@2868 = ~Are you determined to proceed? The bandits will wipe us out in a moment! *sigh* Oh, be it as it may. Nobody ever listens to me.~
@2869 = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. I am so overwhelmed by my unexpected freedom that even death does not sound so imminent. The feeling will pass, I know, but for now I would rather enjoy it, while I still can.~
@2870 = ~Before I was captured, I learned of some strange activity northeast of Friendly Arm Inn. Perhaps we shall find the brigands' nest there.~
@2871 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I can give you no advice. Ask someone else.~
@2872 = ~*Xan surveys your surroundings, his eyes wide.* I have made the biggest mistake in my life by agreeing to travel with you, it seems.~
@2873 = ~I am sure that Durlag protected his dwelling well. We shall have to break the wards he has undoubtedly placed here, if indeed you are determined to proceed. To do that, you will need a wardstone.~
@2874 = ~Watch for traps, <CHARNAME>. In the place such as this, there should be many, and I am not eager to experience their effects.~
@2875 = ~A dreary place you have lead us to, <CHARNAME>. I suggest we escape it as soon as mortally possible.~
@2876 = ~If you are interested, friend, I am a Greycloak from Evereska. It is my duty to watch over the political events of the human nations along our borders. From what I have learned so far, there is some sort of mercantile organization known as the Iron Throne that has been trying to cause turmoil along the Sword Coast. To what end, I could not tell you, as I was captured before learning any more.~
@2877 = ~I am doomed, <CHARNAME>... that is all I can tell you about myself.~
@2878 = ~<CHARNAME>, do not lessen our chances of survival by disturbing my concentration. Seldarine knows, they are measly enough. ~
@2879 = ~I am glad that you have delivered me from dark warrens of the mine. I welcome the feel of moonlight on my face... and all the good smells of the wood. I am only saddened by the fact that death will irrevocably take it away from me soon enough.~
@2880 = ~*Xzar's eyes shift wildly, not a single object or person capable of keeping his attention for more than a second. Finally he produces a vial from his pouch and starts shaking it. Murky liquid inside turns emerald-green and bubbles up dangerously. You figure it will be for the best to involve Xzar in an amiable conversation before he unstoppers that cork.*~ [X#BLANK]
@2881 = ~*Ihr beschließt, dass Ihr nichts weiter fragen wollt, bevor Ihr noch Dinge über Xzar zu hören bekommt, die Ihr gar nicht wissen wollt.*~
@2882 = ~*You observe Xzar for a while longer.*~
@2883 = ~So, Xzar, könnt Ihr mir mehr über Euch erzählen?~
@2884 = ~*Ihr stellt Xzar eine Menge persönlicher Fragen.*~
@2885 = ~*Ihr fahrt fort, eingehende Fragen über Xzars Vergangenheit zu stellen.*~
@2886 = ~*Freundlich und zuvorkommend sprecht Ihr über Xzars Sorgen und Wünsche, in der Hoffnung, dass Xzar sich Euch öffnet.*~
@2887 = ~*Ihr seid es gewohnt, dass Leute Euch ihre innigsten Sorgen berichten... Also versucht Ihr auf Eure gewohnt charmante Art, auch Xzar mehr über sich zu entlocken.*~
@2888 = ~Uh, Xzar? Hello? Are you there, Xzar?~
@2889 = ~I know I'm going to hate myself for asking but... any suggestions, Xzar?~
@2890 = ~Xzar, Eure Stimme klingt... komisch.~
@2891 = ~Xzar~
@2892 = ~[XZAR 1] Montaron, you are so AGGRAVATING!  'Tis disturbing to my demeanor!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR01]
@2893 = ~[XZAR 2] Waaaa!  Mommy I'm a-scared!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR02]
@2894 = ~[XZAR 4] I'm starting to find this group almost... palatable.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR04]
@2895 = ~[XZAR 5] Must we be so insufferably charitable?!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR05]
@2896 = ~[XZAR 6] I'll not tolerate any more of this benevolence!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR06]
@2897 = ~[XZAR 7] I can take this no longer.  May you all die cold miserable deaths!  Farewell!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR07]
@2898 = ~[XZAR 8] A wise choice for leader.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR08]
@2899 = ~[XZAR 9] I tire!  I'll be MUCH MORE AGREEABLE with rest!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR09]
@2900 = ~[XZAR 10] Much as I enjoy these moments of repose, GET A MOVE ON IT!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR10]
@2901 = ~[XZAR 3] I am become death, destroyer of worlds!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR03]
@2902 = ~[XZAR 38]~ [%tutu_var%XZARR38]
@2903 = ~[XZAR 39]~ [%tutu_var%XZARR39]
@2904 = ~[XZAR 11] Mommy, I don't feel too good.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR11]
@2905 = ~[XZAR 12] The trees... move.  Do you not see it?!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR12]
@2906 = ~[XZAR 13] A cutthroat in every alley, but I'll not let them take us alive.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR13]
@2907 = ~[XZAR 14] I'm never quite so comfortable, as when I'm at least 6 feet under.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR14]
@2908 = ~[XZAR 15] I've never liked the sunlight.  'Tis just too... bright.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR15]
@2909 = ~[XZAR 16] I wanted infravision like the elves, but 'tis more than just taking their eyes.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR16]
@2910 = ~[XZAR 17] Something troubling you?~ [%tutu_var%XZARR17]
@2911 = ~[XZAR 18] Your voice is ambrosia.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR18]
@2912 = ~[XZAR 19] Stop touching me!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR19]
@2913 = ~[XZAR 20] If I must!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR20]
@2914 = ~[XZAR 21] I could do no other.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR21]
@2915 = ~[XZAR 22] Hardly worth my time!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR22]
@2916 = ~[XZAR 27] Tell us a story, Monty.  Something with bears and gold.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR27]
@2917 = ~[XZAR 28] HaHAR there Montaron!  Quite the fight, eh chum!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR28]
@2918 = ~[XZAR 29] C'mon Montaron, lighten up.  Must you be so moody all the time?~ [%tutu_var%XZARR29]
@2919 = ~[XZAR 30] Why must you goad us into other people's concerns?  Can you not just let us mind our own enterprise?~ [%tutu_var%XZARR30]
@2920 = ~[XZAR 31] I begin to see your true nature, and 'tis as I expected.  None are as insufferably righteous as Harpers!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR31]
@2921 = ~[XZAR 35] Could we cease the incessant noise?! 'Tis such a pain behind the eyes!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR35]
@2922 = ~[XZAR 36] Smiles everyone, smiles!  This is like some great Fantasy!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR36]
@2923 = ~[XZAR 37] I know dragons with feet like rabbits!  'Tis true I swear!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR37]
@2924 = ~[XZAR 40] I suppose I should feel a sense of loss. How unfortunate I don't care.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR40]
@2925 = ~[XZAR 41] Montaron!  I... I never loved you.~ [%tutu_var%XZARR41]
@2926 = ~[XZAR 34] Ahh yes, the chatter of friends and compatriots! Does it not warm the cockles?~ [%tutu_var%XZARR34]
@2927 = ~[XZAR 32] Oh speak no more, lest ye gorge my sweet tooth!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR32]
@2928 = ~[XZAR 33] I'll not be mocked, thou most slanderous harlot!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR33]
@2929 = ~When asked about his past, XZAR has very few coherent things to say. His desire to determine the cause of the iron shortage seems benevolent enough, but his motives remain unclear. His ramblings seem disjointed, but his faculties are obviously in good enough order for him to be adept at magic. He mutters something about how he and his associate Montaron are in the employ of a powerful group, but when pressed for details he gets extremely agitated and does not speak for some time. He is obviously at least partially insane, and the network that would hire him must be dark indeed.~ [DUMMYSND]
@2930 = ~Take two pinches of mummy dust and call me in the morning.~
@2931 = ~*Xzar says nothing, but his face lights up with such manic glee that you hurry away from him, before he can answer.*~
@2932 = ~Certainly. Help to subdue all of creation to Mummy's will. All the little bits she hasn't got already. But don't ask me *how* to do that. I do not concern myself with trifles.~
@2933 = ~No. You are doing so poorly on your own that nothing I could say would make things any worse.~
@2934 = ~My fondness for corpses does not extend to becoming one. So if there is any available healing resource to preclude that eventuality...~
@2935 = ~Oh, make a *huge* birthday cake of iron. In the shape of a throne. Light *all* the candles and put it out in the rain until it rusts. Then vigorously applaud your own complete wasting of time.~
@2936 = ~Well, if you found a ring of water-walking lying about you might give it to *me*. That would be a very good suggestion.~
@2937 = ~Just one but... I don't think you'd like it. You see, it involves your dying in this place and coming back as a wight. Under *my* control, of course...~
@2938 = ~Of course. I wish you were, too. Or not, as you prefer.~
@2939 = ~Ah... Sweet dreams are made of this.~
@2940 = ~I am precisely where I was five minutes ago. Or two days, perhaps. I forgot which.~
@2941 = ~Naturally. I always am. The question, my good <CHARNAME>, is: "Where are *you*?" ~
@2942 = ~Are any of us? I have a feeling we *should* be somewhere though. Somewhere else, that is.~
@2943 = ~I am. But I seem to be in the process of leaving. Might you have the means of repairing that? ~
@2944 = ~I must be. The giddying sense of irresponsibility which surrounds you, <CHARNAME>, is unmistakable.~
@2945 = ~No, but I wish I were. All these lovely ghosts and *no* control. Such a pity.~
@2946 = ~I seem to be in the middle of the ocean. Without ship, frigate, cutter, yawl or yacht. Not even a largish bathtub that would float reliably.~
@2947 = ~*You notice Xzar looking around nervously, as if he were planning something.*~
@2948 = ~I'm NOT sneaking cookies, Mummy! And... and the nightshade is on the night table, just where you told me to leave it.~
@2949 = ~Oh, shut up, already. I thought it was important.~
@2950 = ~Xzar, it's me, <CHARNAME>! ~
@2951 = ~Nightshade, hmm? A little something, in case Mummy wakes up peckish in the middle of the night? ~
@2952 = ~Cookies? Would it help if I bought you some, the instant we find a bakery? ~
@2953 = ~Eh? Are you setting yourself up as the arbitrix of What's Important? Mummy won't like that. ~
@2954 = ~You mother is dead, you fool. Shut up. ~
@2955 = ~Uh... no. What's this about cookies? ~
@2956 = ~Um... of course she wouldn't. But what was that about poison on her nightstand? ~
@2957 = ~Huh? Oh, hello, <CHARNAME>. Would you like a cookie? ~
@2958 = ~Um, sure. Do you have some? Or maybe I could buy them. ~
@2959 = ~What are you fantasizing about now, necromancer? Food or your mother? ~
@2960 = ~Buy me one? Really? I wouldn't get in trouble with Mummy? ~
@2961 = ~Sure, I'll buy you one or two... more, if you'd like. ~
@2962 = ~Yeah, I'll buy some. Nothing with monkey brains in it though, ok? ~
@2963 = ~Sure. But it would be worth it. ~
@2964 = ~My 'mother' is deceased, thankyouverymuch!~
@2965 = ~Surprisingly sensible of her, really. Going off to join Mummy that way... so useful of her!~
@2966 = ~Reeeeeeeeeally? Honest joe? ~
@2967 = ~Yep! We can have them for dinner, if you like. ~
@2968 = ~No. Your mother wouldn't approve. ~
@2969 = ~No. We mustn't annoy Mummy, must we? ~

For generations they used the iron mine in the center of Cloakwood as their home, but almost a century ago catastrophe struck. As skilled as they are underground, dwarves occasionally make mistakes.  One such incident cost them dearly. They apparently breached an underground river and the resulting flood claimed nearly all of the clan. Yeslick was one of the few survivors, and made his way to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith. They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told of his past. This proved to be his undoing, as Rieltar used this information to formulate a plan to expand the Iron Throne power base in the Sword Coast.  Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and forced him to reveal the location of the mines. Yeslick has been imprisoned ever since so as not to reveal the site to others. Now he wishes for nothing but the chance to right the wrongs that have been committed using his ancestral home.~ [DUMMYSND]

I meself consecrated the mine to serve as a permanent watery grave-site for me kin, leaving it there as a monument to the memory of me family. A handful survived back then, and a handful is no clan.

With nary a coin to his name he resorted to thievery, stealing only from those that he felt could spare it, and swearing that he would quit once he had enough gold to start his own business. Unfortunately he soon grew to love his new lifestyle, looking forward to each hair-raising escape, dangerous break-in, or beautiful woman. Occasionally he would need to leave town for a while, disappearing into the wilderness until things had cooled down and his name was less known. His most recent retreat is apparently the result of a relationship with the female sorceress Brielbara.

@3174 = ~Coran looks at you with his teasing tilted eyes, eager to talk about... anything, it seems.~
@3175 = ~*Tenderness wells in your heart, when you look Coran's way. There can be no mistake that the elf fancies you. Perhaps, you could hint that his efforts to win your favor did not go unnoticed. A nice kiss, perhaps?*~
@3176 = ~*Amidst the fray it is so easy to forget about love. It is like a bud that opened up while wildfire was ravaging the forest around it. It has a doomed beauty about it... You can choose to let it strive for survival on its own or try to protect it. Right now, you'd rather nurture it to life. You abandon all caution for a moment and kiss your lover, Coran.*~
@3177 = ~*You notice that Coran's gaze wanders from the dark sky towards you, and his sharp features become pensive. What is it that he saw that caused this? Or does your imagination play tricks on you?*~
@3178 = ~*Sadness is not always unwelcome or unkind. After all that has passed, your sheltered world shattered, you savor stronger emotions than you ever knew. They taste bitter and sweet, sour and spicy... You cannot quite understand what you are feeling at the moment, but it calls for solitude and reflection.*~
@3179 = ~*The sun is high, and the world is full of hot, vibrant light. Dry grasses crack underfoot, spilling intoxicating fragrances in the air. Coran picks a stem and smells it with delight.*~
@3180 = ~*You pick up a few flowers and carry them, not quite knowing what to do with them.*~
@3181 = ~*You walk up to Coran and stroke his cheek.* I can never resist doing it, Coran.~
@3182 = ~So, beloved, should we go left or right at the next turn?~
@3183 = ~Say, Coran, do I look... erm... bulky in all this gear?~
@3184 = ~*The party sits down for a moment to take a break. You choose to place yourself close to Coran and lean a bit against him.*~
@3185 = ~So, how's Coran doing today?~
@3186 = ~*You nibble on Coran's ear.*~
@3187 = ~*You choose this quiet moment to brush your hair until it shines.*~
@3188 = ~Coran's hood is drawn low today. His face has all but disappeared in its shadow.~
@3189 = ~You slow down for a moment, so that Coran walks side-by-side with you.~
@3190 = ~*Thinking that nobody sees you, you pour over yet another bounty notice in distress.*~
@3191 = ~*You put your palm over Coran's eyes.*~
@3192 = ~*You see Coran, coming up to you with a long grass stem loaded with wild berries.*~
@3193 = ~*Suddenly, the chill and dampness of the place get to you. You shiver lightly and embrace yourself with your hands.*~
@3194 = ~*You light up a torch to see by.*~
@3195 = ~Lle naa curucuar, Coran. (You are a skillful bowman, Coran.)~
@3196 = ~You are a skillful bowman, Coran.~
@3197 = ~*You find Coran's hand and hold it in yours.*~
@3198 = ~Coran, I like you very much, but please don't flirt with me anymore.~
@3199 = ~*Say nothing. Do nothing. Sometimes it's the best.*~
@3200 = ~Coran, I have been praising golden Hanali in my heart, but I have never been to her temple, or talked to her priest. You, in your own words and *blush* actions are her devoted follower. Would you teach more of the goddess' ways?~
@3201 = ~Coran, I think that I'm not yet ready to study the runes of passion.~
@3202 = ~Nothing would please me more than to teach you Hanali's runes of desire so we two could make the love songs in harmony. But, sweetling, if you are not ready for this initiation just yet, tell me, and I will sing to you, hoping that your mind picks up the meaning as intuitively as your body already does. ~
@3203 = ~*When you both are concealed behind the overhanging branches and foliage, Coran lifts you and sets you against the smooth trunk, touching and kissing you feverishly.*~
@3204 = ~O, Hanali, I was afraid you would not come back to me...~
@3205 = ~*Your garments ride down your hips, as easily as if they sense your impatience. Coran thrusts into you, and all the happenings in the world become trivial compared to the movements you make together.*~
@3206 = ~*When he finds a safe nook, Coran lifts you and sets you on some ledge, touching and kissing you feverishly.*~
@3207 = ~O, Hanali, you do like it dangerously....~
@3208 = ~*Your garments ride down your hips, as easily as if they sense your impatience. Coran thrusts into you, and all the happenings in the world become trivial compared to the movements you make together.*~
@3209 = ~*As your lips touch, Coran's arms wrap around your waist, pulling you closer to him. For a moment it feels as if every inch of your body is a part of this kiss.*~
@3210 = ~*Coran eagerly responds to your lips' touch, and his tongue explores your lips and your mouth greedily.*~
@3211 = ~*Coran sighs contentedly* Nothing else matters when you are in my arms, sweetling.~
@3212 = ~*Coran distances you for a moment, but holds your hand.* I need to catch a breath, sweetling, or you will make me lose my footing.~
@3213 = ~By Hanali, you certainly know how to make a man dizzy, <CHARNAME>!~
@3214 = ~Oh, wonder! If only it could last forever...~
@3215 = ~If I were an artist, I would have drawn that kiss. Every hot-blooded person would have had a copy of that painting and envied me, apart from the unlucky few who would have cursed it for scandalous in public and drooled over it when closeted alone...~
@3216 = ~*Coran feels that you have been looking at him, and turns toward you.* Sweetling?~
@3217 = ~*You timidly plant a kiss on Coran's cheek - or whatever part of his face that comes in handy.*~
@3218 = ~Coran, I have heard you boasting about all these women that you've loved. Frankly, I grow curious to find out what was it that they've found in you. Maybe you could give me a sample... *Seeing his eyes flash eagerly, you stay his advance with your hand and laugh lightly.* Just a kiss... a very *small* kiss, Coran.~
@3219 = ~*You trace Coran's high cheekbone with your finger from the corner of his slanted eyes down to his lips. When he turns his head towards you, responding to the caress and closing his eyes, you kiss him.*~
@3220 = ~*You trace Coran's high cheekbone with your finger from the corner of his slanted eyes down to his lips. When he turns his head towards you, responding to the caress and closing his eyes, you kiss him.*~
@3221 = ~Do not go, sweetling... Or at least do kiss me again before fleeing...~
@3222 = ~*Quick as lightning, the rogue catches your shoulders and looks at you wonderingly. It seems strange to you that he makes no attempt to kiss you back, for you would have though that he-* No, sweetling, I will not spoil such a marvel by haste. Come to me in the night, and I will have you drinking my love from my lips... my very soul.~
@3223 = ~Thank you, my sweet girl...~
@3224 = ~A small one? Perhaps it is a good idea to make it small... *He touches your lips with his thumb, his fingernail pricking your skin slightly, then he leans in and briefly teases your parting lips with the tip of his tongue. He brings his mouth so close to yours that it is parted by no more than a hairbreadth. You can feel the warmth emanating from his face, his lips on yours. Then he withdraws.*~
@3225 = ~That's the smallest one I can do, sweetling.~
@3226 = ~Now, did that not feel right and good, <CHARNAME>?~
@3227 = ~Bless you, my kind spirit, my beautiful, my stealthy kisser.~
@3228 = ~*Hmmm... maybe you should use it to find out more about him.*~
@3229 = ~Sweetling?~
@3230 = ~So, Coran... what's your conclusion? Is the night sky set with stars prettier than <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep?~
@3231 = ~Our eyes meet far too often, Coran. *sigh*~
@3232 = ~What you just did - looking at the night's sky, sighing and then watching me is so... so familiar, Coran. Every person's soul is darkness to another and one can err gravely by presuming too much. So, do not keep me guessing and tell me, what you were thinking?~
@3233 = ~I wish I could give you a handful of stars, so you could see for yourself that you are much prettier. ~
@3234 = ~*embraces your shoulders and points at the sky* Did you know that there is a star called <CHARNAME>? Right there - do you see it, sweetling? ~
@3235 = ~The prettiest thing is <CHARNAME> dancing in the starlight for just one man to see. Need I say... that man is me? ~
@3236 = ~I think it's going to rain soon, and we are in for a good soaking. ~
@3237 = ~Am I a basilisk that you are afraid to meet my glance? ~
@3238 = ~A woman's sigh is a precious thing that should not be wasted. *kisses you lightly on the lips* Now, it is preserved. ~
@3239 = ~So, that's why you steal glances at me every time you think that I am not looking? You are bound to go cross-eyed that way, and for what purpose? ~
@3240 = ~Oh, simple things. Eternity, life... You. A fool's way to spend time when enemies are abound. I am afraid that my thoughts were too disordered to convey them without confusing you even more.~
@3241 = ~Well, I imagined you lazing amidst the stars, and myself, I was pulling the coverlet of the night's sky off of you. ~
@3242 = ~That my heart trembles, when I look at you. Just as these shy stars do at the sight of the moon.~
@3243 = ~What is your name, stranger? I was looking for lady Melancholy... is it you?~
@3244 = ~I do not know my name, stranger. But I will take the one you gave me.~
@3245 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I am your lover, Coran. Have you forgotten?~
@3246 = ~Coran, I need a moment alone. ~
@3247 = ~I have many names for you, my moonlight. I call you Joy, I call you Wisdom, I call you Fury, I call you Beloved... You have many names, but none sweetens my tongue more than <CHARNAME>.~
@3248 = ~You will? A rare privilege it is, but is more suitable for a father, not for a lover. ~
@3249 = ~I called you Melancholy, and I feel that I should be the one to take your blues away. ~
@3250 = ~I did not, but I was afraid that you were slipping away from me into the world of past sorrows. I do not want you to run away, light-footed.~
@3251 = ~I will never forget your love, <CHARNAME>, no matter where my path takes me.~
@3252 = ~I remember every gentle curve and the sweetness of your lips. I remember the flight of your fingers... but I think I am forgetting your smile, for it has become fleeting. That which I love most; do remind me of it... Smile, my love.~
@3253 = ~Without answering, Coran walks away, but his smile is understanding. You can return to your revels. ~
@3254 = ~It grows in the Forest of Tethyr, as well...~
@3255 = ~I shall show you the way we enjoy the scents of a summer noon in Baldur's Gate! *You catch Coran's elbow and pull him along, while making a dismissive gesture to the rest of the company.*~
@3256 = ~It must be international... *Coran catches you up in his arms and lowers you on the grass, sits by your side and closes his eyes.* ~
@3257 = ~*You pick up a mint leaf and chew on it - its refreshing smell is strong and invigorating.* Kiss me, Coran...~
@3258 = ~*You pull out a yellowish grass-stem sporting a fluffy top and tickle the base of Coran's neck.*~
@3259 = ~*You take Coran's head in your arms, pulling him toward you and kiss him deeply...* The taste of your lips warmed by the sun is sweeter than honey and...~
@3260 = ~*You jump up in a fury.* Coran, it's DUSTY here!~
@3261 = ~*Coran's lips skim over your cheeks and lips, never stopping. Sometimes there is just a minute difference between a kiss and the touch of his breath. It smells like life itself, sharp and sweet.* It is a pleasure to kiss you in the sunlight, in full view of the world.~
@3262 = ~I heard a request for a kiss. *smiles mischievously* You will have to try much harder...I am quite resilient.~
@3263 = ~*Coran shakes his head.* Not yet. *His fingers caress your hair and shoulders slowly.* 'Tis moment of perfect harmony... let us savor it.~
@3264 = ~*Coran's neck arches backwards and he smiles.* Do you think that I am such a weakling of a man that I will flinch away from this gentle touch?~
@3265 = ~Should I interrupt this torture... with a kiss of your choice? ~
@3266 = ~Try something stronger, love. Like this... *Coran nuzzles his face into your neck and draws a line with his tongue.* ~
@3267 = ~I shall let you tickle me for eternity, because the sun melts fight out of my bones and my heart. I have but one desire now - to love you - and I enjoy such a state of mind and body very much.~
@3268 = ~Are you talking of a thick liquid, golden in color, which by some odd misunderstanding they call honey, not "<CHARNAME>'s lips?"~
@3269 = ~Now, that's what I was going to say! Ah, never mind. ~
@3270 = ~And your lips are a butterfly that came to feed of the honey. Beware, my fluttery friend, for you are likely to stick. *Coran kisses you and does not interrupt the kiss for a few moments.*~
@3271 = ~Indeed, it is. Next time I should chose a pond... but then, you will complain that it's wet. ~
@3272 = ~That's precisely why we need to get you out of your garments... less laundry, you know. ~
@3273 = ~Oh, so your idea was to run around in the midday sun? How... erm... fascinating. ~
@3274 = ~Ah, leave the flowers be. I'll make you a wreath of kisses. *Coran kisses you on the left cheek.* This one is a poppy which is always blushing so prettily... *Coran kisses you on the right cheek.* This one is a tulip removed, yet opening its heart so readily... *Coran kisses you on your forehead.* This one is a Lilly- the shiny beauty... and here is the handful of roses full of passion- *Coran kisses you on the lips numerous times.* ~
@3275 = ~Allow me to make you a wreath from the most fragrant flowers and grasses, sweetling. *Coran swiftly makes a wreath, and it becomes your crown.* ~
@3276 = ~*Coran takes the flowers from your hands and carefully pins them on his cloak. Close to his heart... or his stomach. You would have to look it up in a scroll on elven anatomy.*~
@3277 = ~*Coran takes your hand and covers it with his palm. He looks into your eyes for a while, smiling at you.*~
@3278 = ~One should never resist temptations, <CHARNAME>. And I beg you to be especially weak when it comes to this particular one. ~
@3279 = ~*Coran closes his eyes and murmurs something too quiet for you to hear, but sounding very content.* ~
@3280 = ~Ah, now I shall not wash this cheek until you promise to touch it again. ~
@3281 = ~Let us go right, sweetling, I just love the way your hips sway when you do that! ~
@3282 = ~Take whatever is the shortest way to the surface. I abhor dungeons, dearest. If not for my love for you, I'd be already making it for a place with no roof.~
@3283 = ~My poor darling! We are getting out... very soon.~
@3284 = ~Just keep your eyes on the floor, if the ceiling bothers you so. And do check for traps.~
@3285 = ~We... we cannot leave this dungeon just now, my sweet elf. But I will make up for all the sufferings you have endured.~
@3286 = ~Good. Now if I only can get a kiss...~
@3287 = ~Oh, no need to baby me so. I will... crawl here for as long as you need me to. But you owe me one, <CHARNAME>. ~
@3288 = ~I will keep my eyes on you. One good thing about dungeons is that they are dark, and when I look at you in the dark... I see an entirely different you. ~
@3289 = ~I'd advise you to find another trap-seeker, sweetling. I have been disqualified by failing to avoid the snare you set for me. I am in love with you... ~
@3290 = ~Listen, I wanted but a tender word!~
@3291 = ~*grins* I will be counting.~
@3292 = ~Let us then redouble our efforts to fight our way out of this miserable place! Forward, comrades, forward! ~
@3293 = ~Let us go left, sweetling, I just love the way your hips sway when you do that! ~
@3294 = ~Why not go straight?~
@3295 = ~Oh! I did not think of that!~
@3296 = ~Coran, have you *ever* seen a dungeon where one could go straight ahead and not bump her head into a wall?~
@3297 = ~Because, Coran, the brave heroes always take a roundabout way! More monsters - more glory! Capish?~
@3298 = ~I changed my mind. Let's go right! ~
@3299 = ~I changed my mind. Let's go left! ~
@3300 = ~And, since I follow *her* closely, I bump into *her*... I have no problem with that at all! Lead on, <CHARNAME>! ~
@3301 = ~Right you are! Let's go ri- No, that would be a very bad pun. Let's go left! ~
@3302 = ~Right you are! Let's go right!~
@3303 = ~Golden Hanali, why did I fall for a woman who is capable of dreaming of glory, standing knee-deep in the midden heap? ~
@3304 = ~More monsters - more glory! More monsters - more glory! *sighs* You know, this rule would work outdoors just as well.~
@3305 = ~No, not at all, my love. You look very slim. (Ouf... good thing I know the right answer to *this* question.)~
@3306 = ~Ever guessed why I so yearn to see you naked?~
@3307 = ~No, bulky is when the curves get obscured... you are a fortunate one to look shapely in your gear. I swear, I can tell that you are a woman, even when you are cloaked and hooded!~
@3308 = ~*Coran's fingers intertwine with yours.*~
@3309 = ~*Coran squeezes your fingers gently.*~
@3310 = ~*Coran turns his head your way and smiles warmly at you.*~
@3311 = ~*You walk for a while hand in hand before Coran slips away with a resigned sigh.*~
@3312 = ~Diola lle, <CHARNAME>. (Thank you, <CHARNAME>.)~
@3313 = ~Cuamin linduva yassen megrille, <CHARNAME>. (My bow shall sing with your sword, <CHARNAME>.)~
@3314 = ~Pilin' en'eleeramin maae lle corm. Amin omenta'ta? (The arrows of my eyes sought out your heart; How was my aim?)~
@3315 = ~Ah! *Coran bows* Amin naa lle nai. (I am yours to command.)~
@3316 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3317 = ~My bow shall sing with your sword, <CHARNAME>.~
@3318 = ~The arrows of my eyes sought out your heart; How was my aim? ~
@3319 = ~Ah! *Coran bows* I am yours to command.~
@3320 = ~*smiles and takes your hand* Allow me to guide you, my little bat. ~
@3321 = ~Even if I do not need torchlight to see by, I love how your face looks when touched its glow. It is so much more expressive, because of the dancing shadows, and your eyes are so much more bright! ~
@3322 = ~Coran quickly undoes a clasp under his throat and throws his cloak over your shoulders. ~
@3323 = ~I do not-. ~
@3324 = ~Th-thank you...~
@3325 = ~*You settle Coran's cloak comfortably about your shoulders and press its fur trimmed hood against your cheek.*~
@3326 = ~*rolls his eyes * What? Not your style?~
@3327 = ~Kissing a sneezing maid is very unpleasant, trust me. And I intend to kiss you at least three dozen times tonight. ~
@3328 = ~Sweetling, I would much prefer you wrapping your hands around *me*, you know. ~
@3329 = ~*smiles* It is a miserable place, <CHARNAME>, but at least we can alleviate some of its shortfalls. ~
@3330 = ~The sooner we get out of here, the better. Think about the warm touch of sun on your skin... of fire burning merrily in the forest... of all those wonderful warm things that cannot be found in this awful warren!~
@3331 = ~Wait until I show you all the wondrous games two can play under a cloak. ~
@3332 = ~It becomes you. *smiles* That's much better, is it not? ~
@3333 = ~I cannot resist the eternal chilvary of this gesture... *kiss*~
@3334 = ~*The elf offers his find to you with a bow.*~
@3335 = ~*You take the string from Coran, pull a wild strawberry off with your mouth and hold it between your lips.*~
@3336 = ~Is it... for me? ~
@3337 = ~Coran leans toward you and takes the berry from your lips in a kiss. ~
@3338 = ~This is the sweetest berry I have ever seen, <CHARNAME>. I want you to eat it. ~
@3339 = ~*Coran produces a handful of berries from his pocket and starts eating one of them, grinning at you all the while.* ~
@3340 = ~*Coran chuckles and puts the string on you, as if it were a necklace. Then he pinches away the berry, which nested itself between your breasts.* ~
@3341 = ~Not *all* of it, greedy one. Though you may have this one... *Coran pulls one of the berries from the stem and places it upon his palm.* ~
@3342 = ~I am not a bird to eat out of your hands.~
@3343 = ~*You delicately pick the berry up from Coran's palm with your fingers.*~
@3344 = ~Coran quickly closes his hand, trapping your fingers. Red juice runs down past your wrist from the squished berry, and Coran gently licks it away. ~
@3345 = ~*Coran smiles, as you eat the berry. He looks rather sheepish and happy.* ~
@3346 = ~*Coran flutters his eyelashes, tickling your palm.*~
@3347 = ~Mmmgh... my whole world is you, now. What a comfortable place to live one's life! ~
@3348 = ~*Coran makes few steps forward and trips.*~
@3349 = ~*Instinctively you try to catch Coran, before he falls.*~
@3350 = ~You are too stubborn for your own good! Why did you not stop?~
@3351 = ~*Coran grins, takes your hand and leads you through a complicated dance. With his eyes closed tightly.* ~
@3352 = ~So, now I know that you will try to protect me, should any trouble approach me. *quietly* Sweetling, there is no need. If I cannot take care of myself, do not risk your own safety for my sake. ~
@3353 = ~Why, because I am stubborn, of course. Just like you, <CHARNAME>. ~
@3354 = ~*smiles smugly* I do not stop while what I am doing pleases my lady. ~
@3355 = ~By the very same reason that you closed my eyes in the first place. It's a game, sweetling, and two are playing. ~
@3356 = ~Ah, you have noticed how badly it's written, as well? It does not do you justice at all! Come now, love, let us rewrite it! Hmm... hair color... that's so plain... what will be the best word?~
@3357 = ~Golden?~
@3358 = ~Auburn? ~
@3359 = ~Raven-wing?~
@3360 = ~Silver-white?~
@3361 = ~Honey-colored?~
@3362 = ~Coran, this is a serious matter! I do not need your jokes! ~
@3363 = ~Hmmm... no wonder they had troubles. There is no word to describe it... it's unique!~
@3364 = ~See, and they had it as "yellow"! Now it sounds much better: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, whose golden hair shines in the sunlight, becoming its rival. ~
@3365 = ~See, and they had it as "red"! Now it sounds much better: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, whose auburn locks dance about her forehead like fire's tongues. ~
@3366 = ~See, and they had it as "dark"! Now it sounds much better: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, with hair blacker than a raven's wing. ~
@3367 = ~See, and they had it as "white"! Now it sounds much better: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, whose silver hair shines in the moonlight, becoming its rival. ~
@3368 = ~See, and they had it as "brown"! Now it sounds much better: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, with gleaming hair the color of honey.~
@3369 = ~That's why they never even mentioned your hair... but I shall write over it: with the hair of the most beautiful color Coran has seen and called it <CHARNAME>'s color. ~
@3370 = ~Ah, you have noticed how badly it's written, as well? It does not do you justice at all! Come now, love, let us rewrite it! Hmm... eye color... that's too plain... what will be the best word?~
@3371 = ~Azure? ~
@3372 = ~Emerald-green?~
@3373 = ~Onyx?~
@3374 = ~Silver?~
@3375 = ~Hazel?~
@3376 = ~The sages in Candlekeep looked through books in thirty different languages and could not find the right word for the color of my eyes. It's unique!~
@3377 = ~Azure? Yes, let me pen it down: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep with eyes of dark azure, that will remind you of the Dragonmere on a calm day. Much better now, is it not? ~
@3378 = ~Let me pen it down: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep with eyes shining like emeralds when she is calm and as the sky before dawn when she kisses a man. Much better now, is it not?~
@3379 = ~Let me pen it down: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, with her eyes deep and black, like liquid onyx. Much better now, is it not? ~
@3380 = ~Let me pen it down: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, with her eyes as pure as the most noble silver. Much better now, is it not? ~
@3381 = ~Let me pen it down: The glance of her hazel eyes is as desirable as the coolness of a forest in the high noon. Much better now, is it not? ~
@3382 = ~I cannot believe that they messed up this one! *Pale-brown* eyes! Idiot scribe. Let me correct it: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, with her eyes as rich in color as the most noble gold. Much better now, is it not?~
@3383 = ~And that's exactly how I shall write it down! One can not say it better! ~
@3384 = ~Sweetling, should I get a more interesting scroll for you? Love poetry, perhaps? ~
@3385 = ~There was a paladin once, and a pair of quick hazel eyes led him astray from the path of honor. Long he had fought with the passion that he bore for his lady, but finally one night, when the husband was spending his evening out of the house, he confessed his feelings to the lady. Mystified and curious, the lady was all too willing to induct the paladin on the path of sin. Alas, the brave knight had not brought along his squire to the rendez-vous, and the two of them spent a good hour, panting and sweating, in their attempt to get the man out of his armor. The paladin then announced that this was a sign of Torm's displeasure with their actions, swore himself to chastity and made the lady swear to be faithful to her husband from that day on. Which she did until she encountered a rogue who had never worn anything but a leather jerkin. ~
@3386 = ~There was a ranger once, who lived in the forest, but belonged to a noble family. He knew all the languages of beasts and birds, and excelled at them. Unfortunately, while in the wilderness, he managed to lose fluency in human languages. As it happens, he came to visit his relatives in the middle of a ball. He walked through the doors, and got into the well-lit chambers, full of guests. Not willing to shame his sister, he grabbed for the first lady he saw and danced with her. In the middle of it, the lady started pinching her nose ever so delicately, and showed signs of being uncomfortable around her forest-seasoned partner. Always eager to help a person in distress, the ranger accompanied her to her chair, took her fan and asked if she need him to pass the wind in her face. ~
@3387 = ~Once upon a time, there was a king in Tethyr. During his reign, a Minotaur, or maybe just an overgrown wild bull, or whatever else monstrous, showed up in his kingdom, was terrorizing peasants, eating chickens and carrying away women. The usual scope, you know. As it always happens in such stories, the king placed a call for a hero to kill the beast and promised his daughter's hand as a reward. Nobody stepped up for a time, until one outlandish bard heard of the bounty, got the monster killed, and came to claim his reward. Yet, after one look at the princess, he requested to add to the reward the biggest barrel of good wine either instead of or immediately prior to the wedding night.~
@3388 = ~There was a wizard once, who kept locking himself out of his own magical tower. One day he came back and found the doors open and a gnomish thief going through his belongings. He immediately cast a spell that held the poor sod in place. Faced with the prospect of losing his hand for thievery, the rogue agreed to serve the wizard for five years. So, the mage petrified him and set him on his front lawn, and from time to time when he forgot his keys, he unpetrified the rogue to let him into the tower. They still argue how to count the five-year term of service, for the wizard insists on counting only the time when the rogue picks the locks, and the thief says that he works the rest of the time as a garden gnome.~
@3389 = ~A druid was once collecting mistletoe and saw three beautiful dryads dancing in the meadow. The druid had heard many a story about dryads abducting men misfortunate enough to come too close. The longer he watched them though, the more he was willing to become a victim. So each night he would go around the meadow, coming closer and closer to dryads, and in the end he ended up sleeping almost under their feet, yet they made no attempt at kidnapping. "Well," the druid said then to the dryads, "at least I have proven that all these legends are lies and serve only to blacken the dryads' reputation." "Sir," the dryads replied. "The legends are all true, but abducting you is just as thrilling as abducting an oak tree."~

They are waves and Shuan silk's cascade.~

@3499 = ~[EDWIN 37] Typische Reaktion. Ich frage mich, ob sie überhaupt zu etwas taugen werden.~ [%tutu_var%EDWIN37]
@3500 = ~[EDWIN 40] Pfand verspielt. Wenn das so weitergeht, muss ich mir noch andere Gefährten suchen.~ [%tutu_var%EDWIN40]

Außerdem behauptet er, dass man schon glücklich über seine Gegenwart sein dürfe, und murmelt dann etwas davon, dass er jederzeit abhauen könne. Die Gesellschaft anderer bedeutet ihm offensichtlich nicht viel, und es scheint ihm mehr Freude zu bereiten, mit sich selber zu reden, als mit der Gruppe. Auf seiner Kleidung prangen die Farben der Roten Magier von Tay, doch warum es ein Mitglied dieser Organisation so weit nach Westen verschlagen haben könnte, ist rätselhaft. Es erscheint unmöglich, von Edwin etwas zu erfahren.~ [DUMMYSND]

@3509 = ~Anscheinend hatte schon einer von uns einen Unfall... Und hat einen Hirnschaden davongetragen.~
@3510 = ~Bewundernswert, dass Ihr es mir überhaupt gestattet zu zaubern, konservativer Wurm. Entzündet Ihr Euer Feuer etwa mit Streichhölzern und bewerft Ihr eure Gegner noch mit Steinen? (Anscheinend alles Affen!)~
@3511 = ~Macht Euch keine Sorgen, ich werde es so weit wie möglich von Euch fernhalten.~
@3512 = ~Euch fehlt offenbar das Verständnis für die hohe Kunst meiner brillianten Fähigkeiten. Seis drum. Aber dann fragt das nächste Mal nicht *mich*, wenn ihr mal wieder Schwierigkeiten mit Euren Feinden habt.~
@3513 = ~Ah, wie ich sehe beginnt Ihr zu begreifen, was für zahlreiche Vorteile ein Roten Magiers von meinem Kaliber Eurer Gruppe bringt. Wenn Ihr weiterhin solche Manieren an den Tag legt, werdet Ihr in Zukunft vielleicht einen der vielen Wege kennen lernen, mit denen ich meine Macht erlangt habe.~
@3514 = ~Das ist eine lange Geschichte, <CHARNAME>, aber ich bin momentan nicht in der Stimmung, um darüber zu reden. Vielleicht ein andermal.~
@3515 = ~Die Roten Magier von Thay teilen ihr Wissen nicht mit jedem. Verdient Euch meinen Respekt und ich werde mein Wissen mit Euch teilen. (Oder auch nicht.)~
@3516 = ~Hmmm, Ihr sei interessiert? Oh, bestens. Reist weiter mit mir und ich werde Euch einiges erzählen.~
@3517 = ~Meine Magie ist das Ergebnis langer, gründlicher und sorgfältiger Studien. Es sind Prüfungen, die nur wenige bestehen. (Wahrscheinlich hat <HESHE> noch nie ein Buch <HISHER>en Händen gehalten, ganz zu schweigen von einen Zauberbuch.)~
@3518 = ~Thay hat für jeden Roten Zauberer ein Protektorat vorgesehen. Aber ein Mann von meinen Talent und Können wurde einfach übergangen, ausgerechnet bei einem äußerst fruchtbarem Stück Land.~

Obwohl er offiziell kein Roter Magier mehr ist, können es nur wenige mit ihm aufnehmen ohne zu sterben.~
@3522 = ~Es ist nich für Eure Ohren bestimmt. Seid dankbar, dass die Roten Magier kein Interesse an Eurer einfachen Person haben. (Und sie könnten, oh, jetzt sehe ich: Sie könnten durchaus Interesse haben.)~
@3523 = ~Die Macht der Roten Magier von Thay geht weit über die Mauern Thays hinaus. Bald wird das armselige Rashemen erobert werden, es ist nur noch eine Frage der Zeit. Doch vorerst betreiben wir Handel anstatt uns zu bekriegen. In duzenden Städten haben wir Handelsenklaven, um unsere magische Gegenstäde gegen andere Waren, Reichtümer oder Sklaven einzutauschen. Starrt mich nicht so an. Ihr wisst genauso wie ich, dass diese Welt ohne Sklaverei nicht existieren würde! Sowie uns bis jetzt noch niemand im Handel mit der Magie überboten hat. Die Thayvanischen Händler sind unentbehrlich, auch wenn sie nicht sonderlich beliebt sind. (Beliebt? Pah! Wer möchte schon beliebt sein, wenn die Furcht sich als steter Begleiter bewährt hat?)~
@3524 = ~Jeder Tharchion befiehlt seine eigene Armee und viele Rote Zauberer habe mehrere Leibwächter. So unterhält Thay zahlreiche Streitkräfte. Wie Ihr sehen könnt, wäre es aussichtslos Thay zu erobern.~
@3525 = ~Warum wollt Ihr das wissen? Verfolgt Eure eigenen Ziele und belässtigt mich nicht länger mit Fragen über Leute, die über Euch stehen. (Ja, das sollte es sein.)~
@3526 = ~Eines Tages wird Thay ganz Faerun beherrschen. Das ist alles, was Ihr im Moment wissen müsst.~
@3527 = ~Kein Preis ist zu hoch, solange das Angebot stimmt. Merkt Euch diese Worte, <CHARNAME>, ich lasse nur selten an den Schätzen der Thayvaischen Weisheit teil haben.~
@3528 = ~Thay liegt im Unerreichbarer Osten, westlich des goldenen Weges und östlich von Aglarond. Ich bezweifel, dass Ihr jemals in unser mächtiges Reich reisen werdet, deshalb wären weitere Ausführungen nur Zeitverschwendung.~
@3529 = ~Was? Warum wollt Ihr das wissen, frage ich Euch? Da ist nichts zu wissen! Rein garnichts! Lasst mich allein!~

@3534 = ~Alora ist ein hübsches, lebhaftes Mädchen. Ich hoffe sie wird uns nichts vorenthalten... ah, enthält sie uns etwa ihre durchaus brauchbaren Diebsfertigkeiten vor? (Ja, Diebsfertigkeiten. Das war alles, was ich im Sinn hatte. Ja.)~
@3535 = ~(Ich habe soeben das Wort 'Halbingsfetisch' gehört. Hat <HESHE> es wirklich laut gesagt? Oder ist es nur eine Erfindung meiner Fantasie? Wie auch immer, wenn es so weiter geht, werde ich wohl den ersten Schritt machen müssen. Vorzugsweise einen Fatalen.)~
@3536 = ~Ah... ähm... schon gut.~
@3537 = ~Ich mache das für meinen Aufstieg und nebenbei auch für Thay' Ruhm.~
@3538 = ~Aus mir bekommt Ihr keine Informationen heraus! (Als ob sie die Intelligenz für solch eine Aufgabe hätten!)~

He is apparently from the island kingdom of Ruathym, though he left as a teenager for the city of Waterdeep. His natural affinity for song and poetry was honed to perfection while he trained at the musical college of New Olamn, supporting himself with gold borrowed from any one of his given lovers. It would seem that his skill in music is mirrored with his talent in the manipulation of others' emotions. He skims over explaining how he came to leave Waterdeep, but it was apparently the result of an attempted tryst with Aleena Paladinstar. Piergeiron, lord of the city, discovered that his daughter was being used by a manipulative dilettante and likely became quite furious. Eldoth probably had to flee the city, deciding it was time to use his bardic skills elsewhere.~ [DUMMYSND]
@3591 = ~I'd be delighted to tell you more of myself. I was born in Ruathym, where the women are dull and just as ugly. I arrived at Waterdeep to hone my skills at a young age and left not long after under unusual circumstances. I could go on, but there are more important things at hand.~
@3592 = ~Well, as your best friend, I can tell you a few things. There's been some economic troubles in Baldur's Gate. There's been a lack of iron, and with the tensions between Amn and Baldur's Gate, this has been causing some concern. A mercantile organization called the Iron Throne has been making some headway within the economic circles of Baldur's Gate.~
@3593 = ~Not a suggestion so much as a request. If you could *just* manage to die in a particularly heroic way, I could make a much more popular song out of all this.~
@3594 = ~Hmm. 'If you can't beat them, join them' has always been an adage of some appeal. Bit late to apply it now, of course.~
@3595 = ~'When in Waterdeep, do as the Waterdhavians do'. Not very helpful, I'm afraid, but I'm quite distracted just now by the thoughts of all the places I'd rather be in.~
@3596 = ~Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. And never lie down with a girl who has more troubles than you do.~
@3597 = ~If *you* mean that seriously, <CHARNAME>, I can only suggest withdrawing for a greatly extended period of research and reconnoitering.~
@3598 = ~*looks sidelong at Skie* Endure what cannot be cured. For the sake of your dream.~
@3599 = ~*leers at Skie* Forget the Future! Embrace the endless Now!~
@3600 = ~Why, tap the boundless Silvershield fortune and retire to a life of refined hedonism... or did you mean about this iron-whosis thing?~
@3601 = ~Certainly. Would you prefer one about the deaths of kings? Or the deaths of princes? Or beautiful princesses, perhaps? Or might I suggest 'The Tragic Ballad of the Overweening Adventurer'? ~
@3602 = ~Well, there's one called 'Time Waits for No One'... A little *too* apt, though, I think. ~
@3603 = ~Let's see. 'The Rustic's Education' is a bit didactic. Helpful, though, perhaps. And 'A Bumpkin's Delusion' makes the same points. More crudely, of course. ~
@3604 = ~Hmm. There's 'Drowned in the Sea of Fate.' 'Crushed Beneath the Wheel'. 'Lost and Doomed.' No. I don't believe that I know any such thing. ~
@3605 = ~Ah, 'A Heart of Gold for Sale' fires the imagination, does it not?~
@3606 = ~*ogles Skie* 'The Passing of the Love-Lorn Swain' is the only song I could really put my heart into at the moment. ~
@3607 = ~I haven't finished composing it yet but 'Damn Your Bungling Folly' will be a treat.~
@3608 = ~There's always 'A Lament for a Father' - if you'd fancy an ironic trifle just now.~
@3609 = ~Hmm. 'The Damned of Musgrave's Crypt' might - comparative to our present situation - seem light-hearted enough to please you.~
@3610 = ~There's a *very* old folk-tune... ''Woolly Bully'... I can't quite recall the lyric, though.~
@3611 = ~Why talk, when there are songs to be sung?~
@3612 = ~It would be my pleasure, but perhaps some other time.~
@3613 = ~I'd much rather tell you about a young lady named Skie Silvershield... a very rich young lady.~
@3614 = ~*Garrick has seemed a little distant of late and less chatty. It's surprising. Perhaps now would be a good time to remedy the situation and lift the bard's spirits. And the artists like nothing more than talking about themselves.*~ [X#BLANK]

@3629 = ~[GARRICK 6] Ich kann nicht tatenlos mit ansehen, wie das geschieht.~ [%tutu_var%GENFG14]
@3630 = ~[GARRICK 7] Es tut mir leid, aber ich muss gehen. Ich kann das, was wir tun, nicht länger ertragen.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK07]
@3631 = ~[GARRICK 8] Ich fürchte, ich bin nicht genug vorbereitet, aber ich tue mein bestes.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK08]

@3645 = ~[GARRICK 19] Das Leben ist großartig.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK19]
@3646 = ~[GARRICK 20] Sofort.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK20]
@3647 = ~[GARRICK 21] Gute Reise.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK21]
@3648 = ~[GARRICK 22] Mit Vergnügen, Sir.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK22]
@3649 = ~[GARRICK 27] Vielleicht möchtet Ihr einmal meine Musik hören, Skie, sie ist ganz anders, als die von Eldoth, und auch um einiges besser.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK27]
@3650 = ~[GARRICK 28] Warum bleibt Ihr eigentlich bei Eldoth, Skie? Seht Ihr nicht, dass er Euch nur ausnutzt?~ [%tutu_var%GARRK28]
@3651 = ~[GARRICK 29] Sprecht nicht in diesem Ton mit Skie, Eldoth. Sie hat das nicht verdient.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK29]
@3652 = ~[GARRICK 30] Meine Musik hört sich genauso an wie Eure Eldoth, ich habe das College von Berdusk besucht.~ [X#BLANK]
@3653 = ~[GARRICK 31] Ein schönes Fräulein ist eine ewig währende Freude.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK31]
@3654 = ~[GARRICK 37] Ich glaube, Euch müßten mal Manieren beigebracht werden.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK37]
@3655 = ~[GARRICK 35] Ich halte Euch für eine ehrenwerte Person.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK35]
@3656 = ~[GARRICK 36] Ich kenne keine einfühlsamere Person.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK36]
@3657 = ~[GARRICK 40] Die Welt ist so grausam.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK40]
@3658 = ~[GARRICK 41] Nein. Warum sie? Sie hat das nicht verdient!~ [%tutu_var%GARRK41]
@3659 = ~[GARRICK 32] Vielen herzlichen Dank für Eurer entzückendes Kompliment.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK32]
@3660 = ~[GARRICK 33] Womit habe ich das verdient.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK33]
@3661 = ~[GARRICK 34] Zu einem Streit gehören immernoch zwei.~ [%tutu_var%GARRK34]
@3662 = ~Wenn Ihr ihn nach seiner Vergangenheit fragt, erklärt GARRICK, dass er Teil einer gefeierten Künstlertruppe names Talwind-Troubadoure war. Sie reisten entlang der Küste von Niewinter bis Amn und spielten Oft vor Herzögen und anderen Adligen. Tatsächlich konnten sich nur  wenig andere die Kosten einer Vorstellung leisten, als die Gruppe ihren Höhepunkt hatte. Wie dem auch sei, Garrick spricht nicht freundlich von dieser Zeit, da die Richtung, die die Gruppe einschlug, ihn unzufrieden mit ihrem Verhalten werden ließ. Er entdeckte offenbar, dass die Vorführungen zur Ablenkung für Diebstähle genutzt wurden, und er erklärte, dass er damit nichts zu tun haben mochte. Von seinen Kameraden zurückgewiesen, wünscht er heute, einfach zu reisen und seine Musik jenen vorzuführen, die sie hören möchten. Er scheint etwas jung und naiv, und einen Tick zu bereitwillig, Fremden Vertrauen zu schenken.~ [DUMMYSND]
@3663 = ~Mir geht's gut, <CHARNAME>. Wirklich.~
@3664 = ~Also, ich habe über Silke nachgedacht und ich - fühle mich etwas schuldig.~
@3665 = ~Ja, <SIRMAAM>. Ich habe nur mein Zauberbuch kontrolliert und ich habe beinahe keine Schriftrollen mehr. Könntet Ihr, ähm, mir einige kaufen?~
@3666 = ~Das Leben ist großartig, ich reise mit Freunden und die Leuten hören meiner Musik zu - was bleibt noch zu wünschen?~
@3667 = ~*errötet* Ich habe von Liebe geträumt und, uh,  wurde davon ein wenig mitgerissen~
@3668 = ~Nein, wirklich, es ist ok. Habt Ihr etwas?~
@3669 = ~Mir geht's gut. Hier, lasst mich ein Lied dingen, es zu beweisen! "Der Marsch der Helden!"~
@3670 = ~Oh, danke, dass Ihr fragt! Es ist wirklich nett, dass Ihr Euch sorgt, wißt Ihr.~
@3671 = ~Sicher! Ich singe Euch "Ein Strauß Rosen" - das ist mein Lieblingslied!~
@3672 = ~Uh, seid Ihr sicher? Ich meine, ich würde gern singen, aber das ist jetzt kein guter Zeitpunkt dafür.~
@3673 = ~Ich denke, "Der seltsame Joe" wird genügen. Okay, allemann, laßt uns anfangen!~
@3674 = ~Ich kenne ein schönes Lied namens "Prächtige Liebe im Sonnenschein", aber es, uh, hat ein paar Phrasen, die nicht angemssen für junge Damen sind, wenn Ihr wißt, was ich meine.~
@3675 = ~Ja, <SIRMAAM>! "Des Löwen Herz" ist es!~
@3676 = ~Würdet Ihr ein Liebeslied mögen? Ja, ich wußte, Ihr würdet! Und "Küss mich süß, küss mich heftig" ist genau das!~
@3677 = ~Da habt Ihr recht, <SIRMAAM>! Das Leben ist großartig, und es ist Zeit, das mit einem Lied zu feiern!~
@3678 = ~Ok, denke ich, aber haben wir genug Zeit dafür?~
@3679 = ~Nunja, sicherlich! Das hört sich wie eine gute Methode an, uh, uns gegenseitig etwas besser kennen zu lernen...~
@3680 = ~Also, wie Ihr wißt, ist mein Name Garrick, und mein Beruf ist der des Barden. Genau wie meine Musik, habe auch ich einiges Geschick in Zauberkunde und besitze ein wenig überliefertes Wissen. ~
@3681 = ~Als ich vor ein paar Jahren alt genug war, bereiste ich die Schwertküste mit einer Gruppen Künstler. Wir waren ziemlich bekannt, selbst wenn ich, uh, das so sage, aber... ich hatte etwas herausgefunden, das bedeutete, das ich gehen musste.~
@3682 = ~Wir... ich meine, sie... waren Diebe, benutzen mich, um von denen zu stehlen, während wir vor ihnen unsere Aufführung hatten! Ich war geschockt und erschüttert, <CHARNAME>, es war falsch! Also, wie ich sagte, ging ich.~
@3683 = ~Ich kam nach Beregost und fand Silke, und ich habe in ihrer Truppe die letzten Zehntage gearbeitet, bis ich Euch traf. Und wie Ihr wißt, hat sie sich auch nicht als eine von der guten Sorte entpuppt... Denke, ich, uh, habe eine Art, die falschen Leute zu finden! Aber ich bin sicher, Ihr seid von der guten Sorte, richtig?~
@3684 = ~Also, <SIRMAAM>, ich würde es lieben, mich zu unterhalten, aber drängende Angelegenheiten warten...~
@3685 = ~Nicht, uh, jetzt... Vielleicht später.~
@3686 = ~Wie steht's mit etwas Musik stattdessen, die Stimmung zu heben?~
@3687 = ~*Ihr passt einen Moment ab, wo Khalid von allen anderen entfernt ist. vielleicht wäre es weise, daraus einen Vorteil aus der Situation zu ziehen und ein paar persönliche Fragen zu stellen.

Deshalb widmete sich Khalid den Kampfkünsten, lernte unter die Mitgliedern der Stadtmiliz. Er geht nicht ins Detail darüber, wie er Jaheira getroffen hat, aber seine Verehrung für sie ist offensichtlich.

Dann...n-naja... ich wurde ein Harfner, als ich v-von einigen Bösewichten gefangen genommen wurde, ich wurde mit M-mühe von Gorion und Jaheira befreit. Sie hatten mich g-gefoltert... und Jaheira.... sie pflege mich wieder gesund.

Seine Gewandtheit und seine Hingabe verschafften ihm augenscheinlich die Aufmerksamkeit des Paladins Keldorn, einem der höchst respektiertesten Mitglieder des Ordens, der beschloss, Ajantis als Schildknappe unter seine Fittiche zu nehmen. Kürzlich erst bat Ajantis um die Ehre, ein vollwertiges Mitglied des Ordens werden zu dürfen. Um dies zu erreichen, reiste er die Schwertküste entlang, um dabei mitzuhelfen, die verstärkten Aktivitäten der Menschen in dieser Region einzudämmen.
