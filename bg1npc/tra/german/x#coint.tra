@0    = ~Ah, almost forgot! I have a trinket for you from a secret benefactor. You are young and on the road, my friend... It might well happen very soon that you fall in love with one of your companions. Here is a little something to help you win a heart.~
@1    = ~Well met, Voltine! I am Coran, and you can call me... Coran. What a delightful surprise to meet another elf! And of such an exquisite beauty...~
@2    = ~A thief does not set rules for another thief... gentleman, or not. We will do what pleases us, and if you do not like it – well, here is your chance to make yet another attempt on <CHARNAME>'s life. All previous assailants have fallen to <PRO_HISHER> hand.~
@3    = ~It would be a sad day indeed, if I took some pointy-eared rogue's threats seriously.~
@4    = ~Ah, what a pity... I was hoping to see the amulet decorating that beautiful neck of yours, lady... ~
@5    = ~Get lost, already!~
@6    = ~She does not look too good, as much as I hate to say such a thing of a lady. In fact, she looks like she is about to expire. Perhaps we can escort her to the oceanfront, <CHARNAME>? She is too beautiful to die...~
@7    = ~I'll be damned if I'll be running small errands for a dwarf! Wait... you said the reward would be handsome? Can you give an exact number?~
@8    = ~If I like your work, and you do it fast, there'd be 200 gold in it fer you.~
@9    = ~Young ladies, you have my word that the miscreant will be severely punished for disturbing your peaceful sleep. ~
@10   = ~Uhm... you are indeed lucky, if you are still alive among the stuff you sell. Look at this bottle! It has burned an inch deep hole around itself on a shelf! And this... er, whatever it is... I swear it winked at me!~
@11   = ~That? That's eyes of some lady lich... or, at least, the gnome who sold it to me claimed that 'twas...~
@12   = ~*laughs* You are a happy man, Lusselyn... Looking at you, who would not want to spend their days boozing up and chatting with amiable companions... How about we stick around for a while, <CHARNAME>, and spend these coins to celebrate that we are alive, and to compensate to the good innkeeper for the expense of buying another jelly? ~
@13   = ~Yer a good one, you are... ~
@14   = ~Who would believe rumors, once they looked into your beautiful innocent eyes, m'lady?~
@15   = ~This is... not a light matter... I need him silenced! Please...~
@16   = ~Mmgh... so we are looking for a history of the Unicorn Run? With the title like that, it could be a piquant read.~
@17   = ~I once was told a lovely story about hunting unicorns. You see, they say that if you tie a maiden girl to an oaken tree in the forest, a unicorn would come... So that clever fellow talked a virgin into hunting unicorns with him... Good story, that.~
@18   = ~I wonder if that folio tells of something similar.~
@19   = ~*blushes* It is *nothing* of the kind, of course!~
@20   = ~Sirens' hunt is a cruel quest - listening to their sweet singing, and knowing for true that they but lure men to spill blood that boiled at the first sighting of them. *sighs* I can never quite believe that it is their intent. Maybe, one day, I should stop resisting, and find out for myself.~
@21   = ~I was told that my mother was a siren...~
@22   = ~Knowing you, I am inclined to believe this tale, temptress. I wish I knew how your father... er... never mind.~
@23   = ~*raises his eyebrow* I was not aware that they now call it *entropy* in Baldur's Gate... I was away for too long, perhaps.~
@24   = ~A telltale! He reminds me of my sister Ameniela... Mama! Coran slipped out the window and was out hunting all night! Papa! Coran was kissing Enivien Maervik's daughter... Quite inconvenient. We will have to watch our backs now.~
@25   = ~Guaaards!~
@26   = ~Enslaving a bard to do digging? This Davaeorn has a brain the size of walnut! Worry not, troubadour, we are here to set you all free, and kill Davaeorn.~
@27   = ~If you break us free... I would sing a song of you, even if I would not be able to speak after that ever again.~
@28   = ~Is *that* all?~
@29   = ~Yes, sir. Not to be offensive, or anything like that, but your house ain't much...~
@30   = ~You need material for a ballad? You have asked the right person! Look at this noble looking heroic <PRO_LADYLORD>! Every day with <PRO_HIMHER> can be made into a song, and a week - into an epic!~
@31   = ~*quietly* And every night - into a song...~
@32   = ~Well, give me at least one...~
@33   = ~Gladly. Just a few days ago, we worked on stopping the iron shortage and chased the bandits out of the bowels of Toril... Or as close to its bowels as I ever intend to be. ~
@34   = ~Are you telling me you have been to the Underdark?~
@35   = ~Er... pretty much. There we were assaulted by vicious-~
@36   = ~Drow?! I knew they were involved! Nothing evil... make it just 'nothing'... happens on the face of Toril, without a drow or two involved!~
@37   = ~Er... yes, drow everywhere, skulking in shadows, shooting those poisonous darts of theirs... and their women so voluptuous and evil that you fall in love with them quicker than they kill you, and take it from me, they do it quite speedily...~
@38   = ~*quietly* I'd be glad to demonstrate the killing part to you, stupid darthiir...~
@39   = ~*quietly* Then drop you hood and do it... I wonder how long you'll live after the Flaming Fist learns whom we shelter?~
@40   = ~Wretched surfacer!~
@41   = ~What a splendid tale!~
@42   = ~A fellow huntsman of wyverns, I presume?~
@43   = ~A huntsman, yes. But I have no interest in these... wyverns. I am here for... er... caves.~
@44   = ~Really? And I could have sworn that this faint acidic smell on your cloak is the same that their poison leaves...~
@45   = ~So you are not going to kill the pair? I am not surprised. *Nobody* around here is buying wyvern trophies... I know that for a fact! ~
@46   = ~Er... how long are you  going to stay in this cave, anyway?~
@47   = ~For some time. My... er... spelunking takes time...~
@48   = ~Of course, we can help you out! As they say - take from the rich, give to the poor, and do not forget yourself...~
@49   = ~The three of you cannot win favor with one lady? Me, I alone can win three ladies in the same amount of time!~
@50   = ~You try it then, mate. Only she's no lady, she's a bitch, like her Queen...~
@51   = ~<CHARNAME>, men who call a woman a bitch are not worthy of our help...~
@52   = ~Remember what I told you? With noblewomen, it's boldness that scores. Smile, you rascal!~
@53   = ~You are free, my woodland beauty. Care to celebrate the joyous occasion in a cozy inn? Or in the lovely grotto which you call home... where is it, by the way? Abela?~
@54   = ~*Abela throws a speculative glance at Coran, but then jerks her eyes away and sighs* ~
@55   = ~Bard, your ballad brought to my mind the story of Elf-King Echtellion and the Songstress Inga Highwing.~
@56   = ~I would fancy to hear this tale, Master Elf.~
@57   = ~There is a small settlement of Belgarden in Cormyr, on the lands that now are claimed by humans, but of old, they were Elven. One cruel battle was fought there thousands of years ago, ere the Crown Wars. And in it, the fairest and mightiest elf, King Echtellion, was slain - in some noble fashion, of course.~
@58   = ~To commemorate him, Alaundalion the artist carved a statue, to put on his grave. He was said to be in love with Echtellion's sister, and therefore, to please her, he did her bidding and made the statue very lifelike, against the Elven tradition - for we all know that Elves have little talent for the exact depicting of the features, as they ever try to capture the spirit.~
@59   = ~The sister of the King, wise Ogneda, was enamoured with Alaundalion's work, and she quite often came to honor her brother and lay flowers by the statue's feet. It is believed that Ogneda later became mad, convincing herself that the dead stone was her brother. The magic was strong in her, and aided by her insanity, she turned into a banshee.~
@60   = ~The centuries passed, and even Elves, with their long memories, now have little recollection of King Echtellion and his deeds. Yet the statue stood, as whole as it was on the day of its carving. Many a person came, throughout the years, to see the monument, and went away in wonder.~
@61   = ~Inga Highwing stayed.~
@62   = ~The image of the long-dead King captivated her so much that she wanted to know all there was to know about him. She pieced together what shreds of lore she could find, but that was an unsatisfactory harvest. In her love for the King, Inga wrote her own songs about him, and came to his statue every day, at sunrise, to sing to his stone image.~
@63   = ~One night, when she was in the middle of a particularly moving ballad, oh, wonder! The statue stepped down from the column on which it stood and walked over to Inga. Echtellion lived again!~
@64   = ~The small crowd that gathered round went so quiet that a snowflake's fall would have broken the silence. Echtellion's voice had not grown hoarse with disuse, and the whole gathering hearkened to the words he said to Inga Highwing:~
@65   = ~"Seldarine, have mercy on me! You wail worse than my sister!"~
@66   = ~Wh-what?~
@67   = ~Do not despair, bard. Bad poetry has the power to turn stone to flesh and raise dead... ~
@68   = ~Now, <CHARNAME>, were you going to say something?~
@69   = ~And it better be g-good.~
@70   = ~Er... m'lady, it seems that your romantic ideals were badly effected by your prolonged stay among rough thugs, miners and hobgoblins. ~
@71   = ~Aye, but a shag is still a shag. You're a bit flimsy for me liking, but if you want some-~
@72   = ~Would that I could, m'lady. But alas, my heart does not belong to me any longer. And I am afraid that the one who holds it would bleed it should I-~
@73   = ~Your ladylove would chop you into sauerkraut, if you stray, that's what you mean... oh, well. Maybe another time. *winks*~
@74   = ~Should I have the time, I would have shown you the difference, m'lady... what is your name?~
@75   = ~Cooooran! Must I pry you loose from *every* skirt?~
@76   = ~But you do not. So the littl' bird's name is irrelevant. Now let us go.~
@77   = ~Excuse me kindly, gentle lady, but I must steal my comrade from you...~
@78   = ~You don't even have to turn your back on her, now, for that to happen.~
@79   = ~Coran?! Was murmelt Ihr da?~
@80   = ~Oh, nothing, my brave knight.~
@81   = ~A lark in naught but a cloak around her waist...~
@82   = ~Coran... *sighs* CORAN!~
@83   = ~Oh... did I drift off?~
@84   = ~Once a cute thief, always a cute thief.~
@85   = ~Heya! <CHARNAME> is not the only cute thief in this party, thank ya very much!~
@86   = ~*whispers* <CHARNAME>, being a Greycloak of Evereska... I do have a spare cloak... if you wish to borrow it one day...~
@87   = ~Xan... I heard that!~
@88   = ~<CHARNAME>, you need to show this carefree side of yourself more, you know. It would surely help reduce... tension.~
@89   = ~Our chance of survival is meager as is, and it would only aggravate us all the worse if our leader decided to drop her weapons and attire in the middle of battle... Moreover, while <CHARNAME> is fair of face, I have very little confidence that her revealing herself in such a way would have a blinding effect on our enemies, such as from a spell that a dryad could place on her foes...~
@90   = ~*whistles quietly* What a woman! Your brother must be something out of an ordinary to inspire such deep feelings!~
@91   = ~I hate killing pretty ladies, especially when they got a spark to them.~
@92   = ~Did someone say riches? Nothing is sweeter than the spoils honestly earned by slaying bastards!~
@93   = ~Powerful beyond belief! Why, this wyvern did not stand a chance against us! If you need to slay a wyvern, or a dragon, or some other foul beast, Coran is your man for the job, most holy Kelddath Ormlyr.~
@94   = ~Er, <CHARNAME>, I told you, it was worth our while: a couple of well-aimed arrows, an antidote, and ta-da! Two thousand gold! By the way, I expect a double share of profits for pointing you to this little quest.~
@95   = ~A pleasent fellow, and so laconic.~
@96   = ~Here, Kivan, is an ideal companion for you. You can share many beautiful hours of brooding silence.~
@97   = ~Thank you for the suggestion, but your own solemn disposition is quite enough to keep me at ease.~
@98   = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>! Please, take a look at my ears. Are they curling and withering like blossoms under the harsh winds of winter? Why is it that the most pompous fools come with the loudest and foulest of voices?~
@99   = ~By Seldarine, but when ankhegs spit, they spit big, so we dance as much as we hunt! Almost as much fun as hunting wyverns, eh?~
@100  = ~And an enviable profession that is!~
@101  = ~What do you think, Kivan?~
@102  = ~Cleaning infested, foul-smelling warrens flowing with human's refuse? I think you were born for it.~
@103  = ~And ye be playin' pansy again. Ye turn pale every time the ceiling and the walls are a tad too close for ye liking. Har-har!~
@104  = ~You make a pathetic dwarf, Coran.~
@105  = ~A  far better un than ye!~
@106  = ~I am glad that you pride yourself on this... achievement.~
@107  = ~I'll split ye head like a rotten melon with me axe!~
@108  = ~That's your bow, Coran. Are the fumes getting to you?~
@109  = ~*shaking his head* You are hopeless, Kivan.~
@110  = ~Turned to stone for a bit of burglary? *shivers* What *is* the world coming to?!~
@111  = ~A basilisk? We have a problem, fellow adventurers! Perhaps, you should go forth, fearless <CHARNAME>. Your heart is already stone, after all. Why, for all we know, you will be unharmed by the creature's gaze, like all the walking stiffs.~
@112  = ~I used to envy doppelgangers at carnival time. Women always seemed to recognize me, despite the costumes.~
@113  = ~Ah, I love this city!~
@114  = ~I have heard that a halfling's ales are most delectable. Care to join me and ascertain or disprove this claim, <CHARNAME>?~
@115  = ~Perhaps later on, Coran.~
@116  = ~No, you will have to drink alone. Though, with your talents, I doubt not that you'll find yourself company.~
@117  = ~We have not come here for mead and ale, Coran!~
@118  = ~Ah, nothing is better than an evening in gentle company by the fireplace after slaughtering a ghost or two...~
@119  = ~But I wanted to drink with a nice person... on second thought, that eliminates you!~
@120  = ~No, but now that we found it... I say it is worthwhile to try it!~
@121  = ~Just another cold body... but what a body! Makes me feel sad to see such magnificence going to waste. *sighs*~
@122  = ~And an oddball too... why not hurl lightning and fireballs at me once I've spoken to her and made for the exit, like every other woman? That way nobody gets hurt... unless the furniture in the room has sentimental value...~
@123  = ~That's the easiest money I've ever made! But I must admit that I dislike stealing what was already rightfully stolen... If a thief can cross a thief, what kind of world is it?~
@124  = ~Alas, this Unicorn Run is indeed a history scroll... And a boring one at that! Just listen: ~
@125  = ~Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life, and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source, and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world.~
@126  = ~Oh, well, could have been worse! If I see another 'History of the North', I'll go mad, I swear! It is in every house we enter - was it given away for free by the author around here? Or did he promise a reward to anyone who manages to read it cover to cover?~
@127  = ~Just the ones that are wrapped around a pair of exquisitely shapely legs...~
@128  = ~Yes, yes, I know that with you, it's what under the skirts that counts.~
@129  = ~Lady, do show him your legs, so we can get moving, finally.~
@130  = ~Oh, the variable life of an adventurer! One minute I slaughter hobgoblins, another I receive lessons in seduction. And all in the same mine.~
@131  = ~Ah, you are too down to Toril, my friend, for one so young. You should be still dreaming of chaste kisses and moonlit walks...~
@132  = ~You were just like that at my age, no doubt.~
@133  = ~Is not that wonderful?~
@134  = ~Nobody calls my ladylove a bitch-~
@135  = ~He is gone, you silly boy.~
@136  = ~Oh, Coran, Coran... did he hurt you, my heart?~
@137  = ~Dear me, and I thought that you were wiser than to pick fights with guys bigger than yourself...~
@138  = ~Well... Er... Coward!~
@139  = ~*touches his jaw* Not so bad, but you'll have to be careful when kissing me. The bastard broke my lip. I wonder how he managed to get a hit in so quickly?~
@140  = ~Er... he was... impetuous with his sweet songs and wanton glances. He was *ogling* you! ~
@141  = ~*start laughing* He is not the only one who does such things, Coran... I know an elf from Tethyr-~
@142  = ~Oh, really? How awful!~
@143  = ~*sigh* Let us just go, Coran.~
@144  = ~*sheepishly* Oh... I guess you are right. But you do not mind it... when it's coming from me, right?~
@145  = ~It was! *touches his jaw* I wonder, how he managed to get a hit in so quickly?~
@146  = ~This place shall be an ultimate test of my skills! Dwarven traps, against the nimbleness of elven hands! If I lose, I die, if I win - there is treasure waiting! What a thrill!~
@147  = ~It is enormous... look at it! I have never seen a dragon of that size. I bet it is one of the ancient ones... I guess it died of old age. I wonder what they would pay for his scalp at the Hall of Wonders?~
@148  = ~Good <DAYNIGHT>, lovely. We met and we part, like two fireflies on a windy night...~
@149  = ~*giggles*~
@150  = ~Seems that our mine now attracts the gentle-borns... I'd better do something about my hairdo... and buy new shoes.~
@151  = ~I have not had that much fun in ages! Here ya go!~
@152  = ~Uhm... <CHARNAME>, I'll catch up with you later... much later...~
@153  = ~*quietly* Let me handle this, <CHARNAME>...~
@154  = ~O, Ladylove, the rumor that Lady Brilla Silvershield is the most beautiful Lady in Baldur's Gate reached my ears, and I came here to -~
@155  = ~Was it all over the town? Oh...~
@156  = ~The rumors lie, m'lady...~
@157  = ~Wh-what?!~
@158  = ~*after a dramatic pause* You are the loveliest woman in the world... ~
@159  = ~Thank you kindly...~
@160  = ~May I have the privilege of kissing your slender elegant fingers?~
@161  = ~Certainly...~
@162  = ~Wait! I think I know you! I saw you at Lady's Berayat's Estate, the very evening when her diamond-and-star sapphire necklace went missing...~
@163  = ~*giggles* Serves her right too, the way she was parading it at every occasion!~
@164  = ~Lady Berayat? Oh... diamond-and-star sapphires? Horse-faced girl?~
@165  = ~You were awfully friendly with her...~
@166  = ~I must have been blinded by your beauty... ~
@167  = ~*giggles* But you said you have never seen me before, Elf?~
@168  = ~Er... I lied. Ever since that evening, I was hoping to see you again... I er... even called my comrades to help me to find you...~
@169  = ~How romantic!~
@170  = ~I shall serenade you tonight at midnight, m'lady.~
@171  = ~I will be waiting...~
@1001 = ~Oooh! Thank you!~
@1002 = ~I shall keep that in mind.~
@173  = ~You asked for it!~
@174  = ~Ha! Such swagger! Such bravado!~
@175  = ~You've earned your reward.~
@176  = ~This way, this way.~
@177  = ~No talk! RUN!~
@178  = ~Time to dieee!~
@1003 = ~Have you a tome?~
